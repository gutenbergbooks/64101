  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Two years have passed since the last gun was fired in the
Great War on the Western Front and hitherto no attempt
has been made to place before the people of Nova Scotia a
comprehensive history of the various Military Units and Patriotic
Organizations which won for the Province imperishable fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anyone who makes an impartial investigation of Nova Scotia’s
response to the call of duty will concede that the sturdy little
Province by the sea achieved an enviable record. In some respects
it surpassed the other Provinces of the Dominion in promoting the
successful conclusion of the great conflict—not only by the number
of splendid troops it supplied in proportion to its population, both
for Overseas and Home Service, but also because it had in its
capital city, Halifax, the Naval Base of the British Empire on the
Atlantic Coast, and from its spacious harbor sent many hundreds
of ships Overseas laden with Canadian and Allied troops and
received them after the Armistice when they were employed in
returning the victors to their homes. From Nova Scotia ports,
chiefly Halifax and Sydney, were also shipped munitions, supplies
and equipment required by the Army in the field. The appreciation
of the troops and their dependants on their return from Overseas
of the welcome given them by the representatives of the citizens of
Halifax, and the comforts and kindnesses bestowed upon them, has
been attested by many grateful letters received from homes scattered
over the North American continent. The patriotic work of
the Nova Scotia Branch of the Red Cross Society, with its country
auxiliaries, was magnificent. All other patriotic societies and
organizations gave equally valuable service. In fact, Nova Scotia
played a role in the conduct of the war which will redound to her
glory for all time. May the same sense of unity and spirit of self-devotion,
which characterized her people during the war, be retained
undiminished and be used wisely in time of peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>In giving a review of each of the Military Units which were
mobilized or organized in Nova Scotia for service in the Great War,
narrative has been adhered to as far as possible. Official war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>records were consulted in so far as they were available, but a
great deal of information had to be gathered from personal war
diaries and interviews. The book contains as complete a history
of Nova Scotia’s part in the Great War as could be compressed
into a single handy library volume. And it has several unique
features. It contains many engraved portraits of Nova Scotian
officers who made the supreme sacrifice, of officers commanding
Units, leaders of patriotic organizations, and groups of special
persons and events, and a reproduction of the authentic Nova
Scotia Coat of Arms, granted by Charles I—all of which will be of
great interest to readers of this history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before closing this preface special recognition should be made
of J. D. Logan, M.A. (Dalhousie Univ.), Ph.D. (Harvard Univ.),
formerly Sergeant in the 85th Battalion, Nova Scotia Highlanders,
for his patient, keen, and thorough reading of the entire manuscript,
with important alterations and corrections.</p>

his indefatigable assistance in the compilation of this volume.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Upon the opening of the World War the following were the
principal Staff Officers at Halifax, the headquarters of
Military District No. 6:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Col. R. W. Rutherford, G.O.C.; Col. W. W. Humphrey, A.O.C.;
Major R. J. Hayter, G.S.O.; Major A. H. W. Powell, D.A.A.
&amp; Q.M.G.; Major W. Gibsone, D.A.A. &amp; Q.M.G. Fortress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Military District No. 6 then embraced the Maritime Provinces,
but later in the war, when Compulsory Service came into force, New
Brunswick was made into a separate District, No. 7.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aforementioned Staff bore the brunt of this sudden change
from peace to war, and met and overcame the resultant many new
problems with great credit to themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sudden deluge of work included the calling out and recruiting
up to strength of the Halifax City Regiments, viz.: 1st Regiment
Canadian Artillery, 63rd Regiment Halifax Rifles, and 66th Regiment
Princess Louise Fusiliers, as part of the War Garrison of
Halifax; supplementing this Garrison later by a Regiment styled the
Composite Regiment, called up by Companies from other Militia
Regiments in Nova Scotia and from the 82nd in P. E. Island; calling
out the 94th Argyll Highlanders to guard the cable and wireless
stations at North Sydney, Marconi, Louisburg, and Canso, and
detachments of Artillery from the P.E.I. Heavy Brigade to protect
the Harbors of North Sydney and Canso; the provision of guards
for the wireless station at Newcastle, N.B., for the International
Bridge at St. Leonard’s and Vanceboro, and the calling out of the
3rd Regiment Canadian Artillery and the 62nd Regiment Infantry
for the defence of St. John, N.B.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>This meant that the immediate necessities of war called upon
the Maritime Provinces to furnish, equip and train and keep supplied
some 3,000 officers and men, of whom almost 2,600 were supplied
by the Province of Nova Scotia; and of these more than 1,500
men from the City of Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>This accounts for the fact that in the mobilization of troops for
the first contingent at Valcartier there were not so many men
reported there for duty from the City of Halifax or from rural
Cape Breton as might have been expected. The officers and men,
though keen to enter this larger sphere, were compelled to do this
guard and garrison work, and were only relieved and permitted to
join Overseas Battalions as new men could be found willing to take
their places.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to equipping this force the further pressing duty
upon the H. Q. Staff was the working out of a system of recruiting
to take care of the thousands of young men anxious to get into the
Overseas Battalions as they were authorized, and to train these men
and officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first change in H.Q. Staff came in December, 1914, when
Major W. E. Thompson was called in from his Regiment, the 63rd
Halifax Rifles, then doing duty on McNab’s Island, to take over
the work of Inspector of Outposts and Detachments throughout the
District, with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>This officer succeeded, upon the retirement of Colonel Humphrey
in March, 1915, to the appointment of Assistant Adjutant-General
and Officer in charge of Administration. He remained at H.Q.
throughout the war and until October 1, 1919, having succeeded
to the command of the District in December, 1918, upon the retirement
of Major-General Lessard. He was promoted full Colonel in
May, 1916, and during the summer of that year he acted as
Commandant at Aldershot Camp in addition to doing his work as
A.A.G.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every officer at H.Q. was continually on the watch for an
opportunity of proceeding overseas. The chance came first to Major
Hayter, who was offered the position of Brigade Major at Valcartier
and was permitted to accept in September, 1914. A careful,
most painstaking officer, always at work, always thinking about his
work, he left his impress; and at Valcartier, in England, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>France the same qualities marked his value. His great modesty
may have somewhat retarded his promotion, though he won the
rank of Brigadier-General before the war closed.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time the work of G.S.O. was rather perfunctorily
performed by officers awaiting their chance to go overseas and
was not again severely faced till it was taken on by Major A. N.
Jones on his being invalided home from France after service with
the 25th Battalion. He carried on till his health broke down in
January, 1917, when Major Soulis acted temporarily till the arrival
of Col. W. R. Lang, who arrived in this station with General
Lessard, remaining till May, 1918, when he was succeeded by Major
W. G. Haggarty.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a bit of a struggle between Major Gibsone and
Colonel Thompson for the command of the 40th Battalion, the
second Overseas Battalion to be raised in this District, but the prize
fell to the former, and his place was taken by Major R. B. Willis,
who filled the duties of D.A.A. and Q.M.G. Fortress for the balance
of the war with great credit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in 1915 Major Powell was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.
His special work was responsibility for recruiting and
the organizing, officering and equipping of Units for Overseas
Service. He brought great energy and ability to this work, and
when New Brunswick was converted into a separate District he
was detailed to that District as A.A.G., February, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Colonel Powell was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel B. R.
Armstrong, of St. John, N.B., who came out with his Regiment,
the 3rd C.A., at St. John upon the outbreak of the war, and who
in addition to this command was the representative of the Officer
Commanding the District in New Brunswick, and had a special
supervision over recruiting in that Province. He carried on the
duties of D.A.A. and Q.M.G. for District No. 6 till demobilized in
September, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>His work was of a very high order, his grasp of details was
unusual, and his knowledge of shipping and business affairs was
of great assistance, particularly in connection with the very important
work of transporting, embarking and disembarking troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>This latter work assumed such dimensions that it was found
necessary to provide him with an assistant. Major W. D. Tait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>served in this capacity for a time till he assumed command of
McGill Heavy Battery for service Overseas, when, in June, 1916,
he was succeeded by Major P. O. Soulis, who came out on the
outbreak of war with his Regiment, the 1st C.A.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Soulis was given the special department of Statistics
and Documents, and the supervision of all embarkations and disembarkations.
The combination of these two officers made this
most important work proceed so smoothly that hundreds of
thousands of men went through this port with the bulk of the
citizens not realizing that anything unusual was going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be mentioned, however, in this connection, that the
work of H.Q. could not have met with the success it did,
were it not for the very efficient executive work of Major A. P.
Lomas, the executive head of the Department of Transport and
Supplies during the rush-time of this most important work. Nor
could the work of H.Q. have met with success in this matter had it
not been for the energy and co-operation which the Clearing
Services Command, represented here first by Lieut.-Colonel H. F.
Adams and later by Lieut.-Colonel Cram, brought to its work of
passing troops going and coming through its depot at Pier 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>When after Compulsory Service came into operation the
necessity became evident for an officer to be detailed to give
exclusive attention to the compilation and care of soldiers’ documents,
the choice most naturally fell upon Major Soulis. He made
a close study of the work, and his system met with so much approval
that many of his ideas were adopted by Militia Headquarters and
were put into general operation. Major Soulis continued to hold
the appointment of District Record Officer till demobilized in July,
1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Colonel Armstrong and Major Soulis were South African
Veterans, the former having lost a foot in action there, and the
latter having been mentioned in despatches.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December, 1914, Colonel Rutherford was promoted to the
rank of Brigadier-General, and in October, 1915, was given his step
to Major-General. He was an officer of much more than ordinary
attainments, and filled well the office of General Officer Commanding,
always carrying the confidence and respect of his Staff.
A noticeable increase in defective hearing shown during a
conference of General Officers at Ottawa led Militia H.Q. to bring
about his retirement, and in November, 1915, he was succeeded
by Major-General Thomas Benson.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS STAFF, M.D. 6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>General Benson brought a long training in military affairs, a
broad outlook, an attractive personality, and good judgment to cope
with the many questions arising in the District. He gave up his
command in February, 1918, to the regret of his Staff and of
citizens who had been wont to do business at Military Headquarters.
He was given leave till July 1st of that year, and his
valuable services were recognized by investment with the order of
C.M.G.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Benson’s successor was Major-General T. L. Lessard,
who retained command till December 28, 1918, when he was
succeeded by Colonel W. E. Thompson.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work done by the Garrison at Halifax during the war was
most arduous, exacting and valuable. From August 7, 1914,
when Canada entered the war till final demobilization, the work
was kept up continuously, and upon the strictest laws of military
discipline.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only such officers whose places could be filled by volunteers
were permitted to proceed Overseas, and no man was relieved for
this broader field of action unless there was a man ready to take
his place. This being so, it was the exception for an officer once
on the Staff or for any well-trained officer of the Units out,
particularly of the Artillery, or for good non-commissioned officers
and specialists to get a chance for Overseas. They all knew that
should the war terminate without their getting over they would for
the rest of their lives be compelled to explain that they were not
permitted to go and felt keenly how flat such an explanation would
fall. They had, however, the consolation that they were doing a
necessary and valuable work and were buoyed up with the hope
their chance would yet come; and if not, the State would at least
recognize their voluntary services as at least equal to the services
of those, many of whom were draftees, who had not proceeded
further than England or St. Lucia. Up to the time of writing,
however, no such recognition has been forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above sets out in most skeletonized form the ordinary
duties of H.Q. consequent on the Country being at war, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Port of Halifax being the only port of embarkation and disembarkation
for Canadian troops and supplies of war during the most
strenuous months of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition were the extra responsibilities of caring for troops
awaiting embarkation. These troops were not only Canadians
but also troops from United States, Australia, New Zealand and
some 50,000 laborers from China.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a contingent passed through the port, either coming in
or going out, from illness or other causes some were left behind,
and these had to be cared for, often taxing the facilities of the
barracks and hospitals to their utmost. In the summer of 1918
when we encamped at Aldershot, some 5,000 United States troops
and a whole shipload was suddenly disembarked at Sydney suffering
from the “flu.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The temporary derelicts from Canadian troops passing through
the City of Halifax were taken care of by being attached to the
Composite Battalion, under Lieut.-Col. H. L. Chipman. When
ready for Overseas these were attached to another unit going
through. The records show the number of such exceeded 10,000
men. Lieut.-Colonel Chipman deserves special mention for his
splendid administration of the Composite Battalion and for his
wise handling of many difficult problems not to be met in an
ordinary Garrison Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, the awful catastrophe which befell the City of Halifax
on December 6, 1917, when a ship loaded with high explosives
exploded in the harbor, spreading death and devastation broadcast,
placed a great burden upon the Garrison and proved its great value
in a sudden emergency. Every officer and man of every Military
Unit and Department, with all the military facilities of the Garrison
were rushed into the work of removing the dead and wounded,
fighting fires, preparing shelters, transporting and feeding the
destitute, doing police duty and the hundred and one things that
came to the hands of a willing, well-trained body of troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ordnance, under Lieut.-Col. Arthur Panet, opened wide
its doors, and one of the first orders issued from H.Q. was for
every available man of the 63rd from McNab’s and the 66th from
York and also every artilleryman of the 1st C.A. from the forts
to be rushed to the city and, proceeding to the devastated area by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>way of the Ordnance Yard, for each to carry with him a blanket
for the wounded and destitute. This order was fully carried out,
Col. Panet, though himself wounded, travelling continuously to and
from the area of most suffering to see that as many as possible
were cared for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major H. P. Lomas, then at the head of the Department of
Supplies and Transport, met the necessities of the sufferers with
the same breadth of judgment, bigness of heart and broad interpretation
of regulations which marked his most successful administration
throughout the war of this the essentially business
department of the Service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elsewhere in this publication will be found articles dealing with
specific work done in this District during the war, so that in this
article it is only attempted to give a general idea of who sat at
Headquarters during these strenuous times and a general idea of
the work they were called upon to originate and supervise; and it
must be borne in mind as the detail of this specific work is studied
and admired or condemned, the responsibility and the direction was
always with that often maligned, seldom praised or congratulated,
but nevertheless patient, long-suffering, faithful, headquarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>This article cannot properly close, however, without mention of

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <em>THE 6th CANADIAN MOUNTED RIFLES.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 6th Canadian Mounted Rifles was recruited from the
different Maritime Provinces Militia Cavalry Regiments—“A”
Squadron from the 8th P.L.F. (headquarters Sackville,
N.B.), and 36th P.E.I. Light Horse (headquarters Charlottetown,
P.E.I.); “B” Squadron from the 28th N.B. Dragoon Guards
(headquarters St. John, N.B.), and “C” Squadron from the 14th
King’s Canadian Hussars (headquarters Canning, Nova Scotia).</p>

<p class='c007'>The establishment of officers and warrant officers consisted of
the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>O.C., Lieut.-Col. R. H. Ryan, South African, Russian-Japanese,
American-Mexican Wars; 2nd I.C., Lieut.-Col. A. E. Ings, Militia
Long Service Medal; Capt. and Adj., Capt. B. W. Roscoe (later
Capt. J. W. Long); Q.M., Major R. A. March; O.M., Major Colin
Macintosh; Chaplain, Capt. G. A. Kuhring; M.O., Capt. F. A. R.
Gow; Sig. Off., Capt. H. R. Emmerson; Asst. Adj., Lieut. E. M.
Arnold; Vet. Off., Lieut. J. S. Roy; R.S.M., L. W. Long.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“A” Squadron</em>—O.C., Major A. J. Markham; 2nd I.C., Capt.
B. W. Roscoe; Lieut. A. T. Ganong, Lieut. G. N. D. Otty, Lieut.
G. R. Barnes, Lieut. W. D. Atkinson, Sqd. Sgt.-Major N. Dawes.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“B” Squadron</em>—Major C. H. McLean; 2nd I.C., Capt. M. A.
Scovil; Lieut. E. J. Mooney, Lieut. E. A. Thomas, Lieut. H. S.
Everitt, Lieut. Geo. Morrisey, Sqd. Sgt.-Major J. M. Lamb.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“C” Squadron</em>—Major T. A. Lydiard; 2nd I.C., Capt. J. C.
Gray; Lieut. H. H. Pineo, Lieut. J. P. Knowlton, Lieut. W. J.
Brown, Lieut. H. L. Bowness, Lieut. B. M. Beckwith, Sqd. Sgt.-Major
George Gill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Ryan and many of the officers and other ranks had
volunteered at the outbreak of the war but owing to the expected
necessity for the employment of mounted troops in the Maritime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Provinces (the 14th K.C.H. having actually received orders for
mobilization) their services were not accepted. It was also intimated
to Colonel Ryan, who was at Valcartier, when the First
Division was mobilized, that in the event of the Maritime Province
Cavalry not being mobilized as Militia Units for home service he
would be permitted to raise a Cavalry Regiment from these Units
and would be given command thereof, owing to his previous service
and experience in the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly Colonel Ryan returned to Nova Scotia and in
December, 1915, received orders to recruit the Regiment.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AT AMHERST, N.S.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Regiment was mobilized at Amherst, N.S., mobilization
dating from March 17, 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period during which the Regiment was quartered at
Amherst was spent in perfecting the organization, taking on recruits
and training the latter, owing to restrictions being largely confined
to setting-up exercises, arm drill and route marching with inspections
by various Generals.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at Amherst a draft of two hundred volunteers was sent
as reinforcements to the Infantry Regiments in England to make
up for the losses sustained by the Canadians in the Second Battle
of Ypres. These were replaced by new recruits.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AT VALCARTIER CAMP.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In May, 1915, the Regiment was moved to Valcartier, being
brigaded with the 4th and 5th C.M.R.’s, under command of Colonel
(later Brigadier-General) C. A. Smart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Training at Valcartier was intensive and performed on foot, as
horses had not been received, the Cavalry formation being however
retained. Here the Unit received instruction in musketry and rather
prided themselves in their ability in this line.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at Valcartier and also when at Amherst they were asked
if they would volunteer to serve as dismounted troops, and the
answer was always that “we will serve in any way we are needed.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>IN ENGLAND.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The 6th C.M.R. left Valcartier early in July for England,
embarking at Quebec on the slow South American cold storage
boat <em>Herschel</em>. Naturally the accommodations were not of the best,
as there were six hundred men and four hundred horses on a boat
without practically any passenger accommodation. Their eleven
days’ voyage ended at Devonport, where they got a great reception.
At Exeter they were met at the station by the good ladies of that
town and given bags of food and fruit, and had their water bottles
filled with hot coffee and tea. Many times since has this been spoken
of in grateful words by the men, who were hungry and cold from the
long train journey. On arrival at Camp in Dibgate they found
themselves once more camping in the sand. As active service in
Egypt had been spoken of, the Unit thought the authorities must be
trying to accustom it to its future surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at Dibgate the Unit received a draft of officers and men
from the 8th C.M.R., under command of Lieut. T. D. Johnstone
(later Capt. in Command of “B” Co., 5th C.M.R., wounded):
second in command, Lieut. H. N. Bate (transferred to R.C.D.’s,
when Regiment was broken up). Many of the men who had been
sick, owing to the strenuous training, had been transferred to
hospital, and when convalescent were sent to the Cavalry Reserve
Depot. These had been replaced by the draft of men from the 8th.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>IN FRANCE—PLOEGSTEERTE—MESSINES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Regiment proceeded to France on October 24, 1915, the
Brigade being attached to General Seely’s Cavalry Division, operating
as Corps Troops in the areas of Ploegsteerte and Messines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following officers and warrant officers went to France with
the Regiment and saw service at Ploegsteerte and Messines during
the fall and early winter months of 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>O.C., Lieut.-Colonel Shaw (later O.C. 1st C.M.R., killed in
action June 2, 1916).</p>

<p class='c007'>2nd I.C., Lieut.-Colonel Ings: Adjt., Capt. J. W. Long: Q.M.,
Major R. A. March (later to 4th C.M.R. Battalion); P.M., Major
C. McIntosh (later to Can. Artillery); M.O., Capt. F. A. R. Gow
(later to Can. Artillery); Sig. Officer, Capt. H. R. Emmerson (later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Major 219th Infantry Battalion); Vet. Officer, Lieut. J. A. Roy
(later to Fort Garry Horse).</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“A” Squadron</em>-Major A. J. Markham (later to Fort Garry
Horse), Capt. B. W. Roscoe, Lieuts. A. T. Ganong, G. N. D. Otty,
G. R. Barnes, T. D. Johnstone; Sqd. Sgt.-Major N. Dawes.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“B” Squadron</em>—Major C. H. McLean, Capt. M. A. Scovil,
Lieuts. E. J. Mooney, E. A. Thomas, H. S. Everett, George
Morrisey; Sqd. Sgt.-Major J. M. Lamb (all later to 4th C.M.R.
Regt.).</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“C” Squadron</em>—Major T. A. Lydiard (later to R.C. Dragoons),
Capt. J. C. Gray, Lieuts. H. H. Pineo, J. P. Knowlton,
B. M. Beckwith, H. N. Bate; Sqd. Sgt.-Major Geo. Gill, D.C.M.,
later R.S.M. 5th C.M.R.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Colonel Ryan transferred to the Artillery, in which he
served with distinction to the end of the war being decorated for
conspicuous gallantry in the field.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>REORGANIZED AS INFANTRY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Division was withdrawn from the trenches in December,
1915, and orders were subsequently received that the 1st and 2nd
C.M.R. Brigade should be reorganized into the 8th Canadian
Infantry Brigade, consisting of 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Battalions of
Mounted Rifles. The junior Regiments in each Brigade, namely
the 3rd and 6th C.M.R., were split up between the two senior
Regiments, thus forming four Infantry Regiments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ostensible reason for this was the necessity of relieving
infantry in trenches and the unsuitability of the cavalry formation
for that purpose. The change in formation necessitated the transfer
to England of officers of senior rank.</p>

<p class='c007'>The command of the reorganized Brigade was assumed by Brig.-Gen.
V. A. S. Williams on January 1, 1916, and training in infantry
drill and tactics was gone at in dead earnest by all ranks.</p>

<p class='c007'>This training continued both in the line and out and the Brigade
occupied the Ploegsteerte area until March, 1916, when it was moved
to the Ypres Sector as part of the newly-formed 3rd Division,
commanded by General Mercer, and took over the Hooge-Hill 60
Sector.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The disposal of the various Squadrons of the 6th C.M.R. was as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“A” and “C” Squadrons were formed into “D” Company of
the 5th C.M.R. Battalion, the company officers and warrant officers
being:</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain B. W. Roscoe (later Major, D.S.O., 2nd I.C. 5th C.M.R.
Battalion, wounded June 3, 1916, at Sanctuary Wood); 2nd I.C.,
Captain H. H. Pineo (later killed in action at Mt. Sorrell, Ypres
Sector, July, 1916); Lieuts. A. T. Ganong, G. N. D. Otty, G. R.
Barnes; Lieut. J. P. Knowlton (later to record office at Rouen, and
received promotion there to Captain); C.S.M. George Gill (later
R.S.M. 5th C.M.R. Battalion); “B” Squadron was formed into
“D” Company of the 4th C.M.R. Battalion, the company officers
and warrant officers being: Major C. H. McLean (later 2nd I.C.
4th C.M.R. Battalion); Capt. M. A. Scovil; Lieut. George
Morrisey.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SANCTUARY WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The first serious engagement in which the Brigade was concerned
was the Battle of Sanctuary Wood, which began June 2,
1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disposition of the Brigade was: 1st and 4th C.M.R., front
line and close support; 5th C.M.R., Battalion H.Q. and three Companies
in support at Maple Copse; one Company in reserve at
Zillebeke Bund; 2nd C.M.R. in Brigade reserve near Poperinghe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning of June 2nd was clear with good visibility. About
8 a.m. the Hun started a heavy bombardment, which grew in intensity,
and information was received that an attack was in progress
on the sector held by the 7th and 8th Brigades. The bombardment
continued unabatingly, and about twelve o’clock mines were seen
to be blown. The whole of the area held by the two Brigades was
being systematically and furiously shelled, and communication with
the forward area was impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>About 2 p.m. Captain Roscoe received orders to reinforce with
his Company, the remainder of the Battalion at Maple Copse. There
was no route specified, the officer conveying the order remarking
that he hoped they would get through.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The only other officer with the Company at this time was Lieut.
G. N. D. Otty, but it developed that the N.C.O.’s had the requisite
requirements of leadership and judgment. The Company, led by
Captain Roscoe, advanced to the support of the remainder of the
Battalion, and in full view of the enemy, through an extremely
heavy barrage of fire, reached Maple Copse with few casualties,
reporting to Lieut.-Colonel G. H. Baker, then commanding the
Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orders were then received to connect up with the 7th Brigade
on the left, to dig in and hold the Copse to the last. Then it was
that the N.C.O.’s showed those qualities of leadership and judgment,
which later were to be recognized in a substantial manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>C.S.M. George Gill, with twenty men was ordered to occupy and
hold a strong point whose garrison had been killed. This he did
with great bravery, showing much skill in defending the position.
Sgts. George Chase, H. McGarry and T. W. Martin led detachments
through the Copse and dug in on the edge next the enemy. Lieutenant
Otty was absolutely fearless in assisting in the disposition of
the Company, refusing to avail himself of anything that looked like
shelter. He remarked to the Company Commander that if he was
to be killed that would happen and that his men were his first
consideration. Unfortunately he was hit and killed within a short
time after arrival at the Copse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy made several ineffectual attempts to break through
the line, and at each repulse his artillery fire became more severe.
There was absolutely no shelter from his fire, and the Copse was like
an inferno. The Company held the position, and were reinforced the
next morning by the 2nd C.M.R.’s. After this things quieted down
and the remnants of the Company marched out that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the roll-call on relief only one officer (Lieutenant Barnes) and
twenty men answered their names, the remainder of the Company
which went into action 130 strong, having been either killed or
wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Roscoe had been wounded on the morning of June 3rd,
after the 2nd C.M.R.’s had arrived, and the command of the Company
was taken over by Lieutenant Barnes, who was the Battalion
Bombing Officer, and with his bombers had been active in the
defence of the position. Lieutenant Barnes made several very daring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>patrols, practically between the posts of the enemy, who had
attempted to push down hill in the long grass. It was through his
efforts that the Unit was able to concentrate its rifle fire on the
dangerous places and dislodge several machine guns. Lieutenant
Barnes afterward got the M.C. for his work on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion, reduced to some 300 all ranks, moved into rest
billets, and the losses were filled by a large draft of officers and
other ranks from England.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the reorganization of the Battalion Major D. C. Draper
(later Brigadier-General Commanding the Brigade) became O.C.
(Lieut.-Colonel Baker having been killed in the engagement);
Captain Roscoe was promoted to be second in command, awarded
the D.S.O. for his work on the occasion and mentioned in
despatches. The command of “D” Company was taken over by
Lieut. H. H. Pineo (later promoted Captain), with Lieutenant
Barnes, 2nd I.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sergt. Harold McGarry was promoted to C.S.M. in place of
George Gill, who was awarded the D.C.M. and promoted to be
Regtl. Sgt.-Major for his meritorious services and bravery evinced
during the battle. Sergt. Geo. Chase, who was severely wounded,
was awarded the Military Medal and slated for a commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 4th C.M.R. Battalion also lost heavily in the battle, and
“D” Company of that unit thereafter practically lost its identify
as a Maritime Province Company, owing to the casualties suffered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The command of the Brigade was taken over by Brig.-General
J. H. Elmsley, D.S.O. (afterward Major-General), replacing
General Williams, taken prisoner in the battle, while the command
of the Division devolved upon Major-General Lipsett, D.S.O. (later
killed in action), the Divisional Commander, General Mercer having
been killed during the action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Brigade, and incidentally the Company, under the new
command had another very strenuous period of training, and after
an initiation trip for the new men the whole Company moved up
again to take their place in the line. While in training they had
the benefit of the advice of a C.S.M. from the Welsh Guards,
which was a great help, especially to the N.C.O.’s. This training
showed later on the Somme.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>THE BLUFF—MOUNT SORELL LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On the first trip in after the June fight, the Unit took over the
line on Mount Sorell. The first night in, the Hun started his
regular trench mortar strafe. One of the first of these landed on
the signallers’ dugout, next company headquarters, and buried the
men on duty there. Captain Pineo and Lieutenant Barnes, together
with some of the men, started in to dig them out. At that time
they could still hear the men groaning. Almost immediately afterward
the Hun threw over another trench mortar. The men saw it
coming by the trail of sparks, and all scattered up and down the
trench. Captain Pineo was struck and instantly killed. The work
of rescuing the men who had been buried need not have been performed
by him. It was his anxiety for his men that cost him his
life. Lieutenant Barnes at once took over the command of the
Company. Word was here received that the Hun had dug some
mines under the trench occupied by the Company, and to be on the
lookout. During the night a party who were digging out in front
uncovered a mine sap and on pulling up some planks from the roof
saw a man with a lighted candle passing under the lines. Explosives
were immediately obtained and the sap blown. This evidently
put the “wind up” the Hun for he blew the remaining mines, some
of which were hardly clear of his wire.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AT THE SOMME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after this the Unit left for the Somme, arriving in
Albert on September 1st, after a long, hard march, and severe
training. They moved up in support and were selected as one of
the two Companies to be first over the top. In this engagement,
owing to previous officer casualties, the sergeants had to lead
Platoons. The attack on September 15th between Moquet Farm
and Courcellette was the first occasion in which the Tanks were used.
The Unit had wonderful success on this day, losing very few men
in the attack. Afterward, out of one hundred and twenty, forty
were killed and sixty wounded, holding the trench. Lieutenant
Barnes was awarded the bar to the M.C. and his majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>for his work on this occasion. No one could speak too highly
of the way in which he led his men, and it was largely due
to his dash that the attack was so successful. Mention should
be made here of Sergeant Lowther, who was left behind with a
party of ten men to garrison the trench until relieved by incoming
troops. He lost a leg and several of the men were killed and
wounded before the relief was accomplished. Sergeant Lowther
was awarded the M.M. Sergt.-Major McGarry, who had been
recommended for a commission, was killed in this action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit’s next attack was on October 2nd when “D” Company
was in support. The objective was Regina Trench, strongly
held by two divisions of German Marines, who had just been
brought from Ostend to try and stop the Canadians. This was one
of the stiffest hand-to-hand fights the Company ever had, and
naturally the casualties were very heavy. Several times the Company
managed to bomb several hundred yards of trench clear, but
each time the Hun would come back with reinforcements. At
daybreak, with bombs and ammunition completely exhausted, the
few survivors were forced to withdraw to the jumping-off trench.
Every officer engaged was either killed or wounded. Sergt.-Major
Holmes, who led the Company on this occasion, after the officers
were knocked out, was awarded the M.M. Captain Beckwith, who
had been detailed as O.C. of the 8th L.T.M. Battery, and had joined
the Company for this occasion was wounded in the face. His
leadership and energy were of great assistance, and it was largely
due to him and his battery who were carrying ammunition that the
Company was able to hold on as long as it did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the time at the Somme was spent in relieving
and holding front-line positions. The Battalion was complimented
by the Army Commander for its fine work while at the Somme, a
personal visit being paid by him to Battalion Headquarters for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the decorations mentioned as being won here,
many of the officers of the Battalion were cited for bravery and
gallantry in the field. Sergeant T. W. Martin was awarded the
M.M. and slated for a commission for a daring reconnaissance of
the enemy line under artillery fire.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>ON THE VIMY FRONT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Unit’s next move was to the Vimy front, where it was soon
apparent that preparations were being made for a terrific onslaught
on the Hun. Some time was spent here in assisting in the work of
preparation, after which the Unit was withdrawn with the rest of
the Brigade for a period of intensive training in attack over a taped
layout of the enemy trenches. The Unit was then moved up to its
part of the line, being in close support to the 4th C.M.R. Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battle of Vimy Ridge will live in history as the great
achievement of the war, owing to the position being considered
impregnable and the fact that it was captured with inconsequential
losses, mainly due to a well considered plan of attack, absolute
co-operation between all branches of the service and thoroughness
of preparation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Company carried on with the usual steadiness during
the engagement and rendered valuable assistance, its losses being
negligible.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ON THE DOUAI PLAIN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>For some time after the capture of Vimy Ridge it was found
impossible to bring up the artillery within range, as the Hun had
retired to a line on the outskirts of Lens and Douai. The Company,
with the rest of the Battalion, pushed over the Ridge and were in
position as a sacrifice Battalion to fight to the last man, in the event
of a counter attack being launched to retake the Ridge. Trenches
were constructed, deepened and strengthened, but the expected did
not happen, and finally the guns were able to get up within range,
from which time ordinary trench routine was resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>During a tour in the trenches on this front a raid was attempted
by the Hun on the Company front. It was unsuccessful, the enemy
being repulsed with heavy loss.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Holmes was awarded the M.C. for his work on this
occasion, displaying great coolness and gallantry in holding off
single-handed, until reinforced, a party of Huns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion at this time was under the command of Major
Roscoe, D.S.O., who the day following the attempted raid received
a message from the Divisional Commander complimenting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Battalion on their steadiness during the attack. A few days after
the Brigade was withdrawn from this sector.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Company, which up until now had been practically all Maritime
Province men, under the new reinforcement scheme drew
their men from Quebec, and for a while the Company was made up
almost entirely of French-Canadians. After Passchendaele, during
which the Company gave its usual assistance to the Battalion, the
wounded men began to come back as well as some of the N.C.O.’s
who had been granted commissions, and once again it became a
Maritime Province Company. It was at Passchendaele that Capt.
L. C. Eaton was killed, just before going over the top.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the winter of 1917 the Unit moved back to their old front at
Vimy. In March, 1918, the Battalion put on a raid of 250 men.
Lieutenants Gillis and Young of the old “D” Company took part in
this, and were both awarded the M.C. for their work. Gillis in
particular had done some very fine work during the second attack
on the Somme. He had come back from hospital with an unhealed
wound in his arm, and although it was too late for him to secure a
rifle and the necessary equipment, he took a pick-axe handle and
joined his Company in going over the top. He brought back the
prisoners, sixty in all, taken on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a pleasant spring spent in reinforcing different parts of
the line, in August the Unit once again took the road south for
Amiens. The work done by the Company during this attack was
spectacular. One of their accomplishments was the capture of
a 5.9 Battery in action at point-blank range. One of the old 6th
men was awarded the D.C.M. for his work on this occasion and
Lieutenant Barnstead was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his
leadership.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Smith was very seriously wounded during the next
scrap in front of Arras, called the Second Battle of Arras. He had
been a stretcher-bearer-Sergeant with the old Company and was
awarded a commission in the spring of 1917. He was given the
M. C. for his work at Arras in the taking of Monchy. He afterwards
died of wounds in London. His work all the time he had
been with the Battalion had been exceptional and the award of his
M.C. was very popular.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The next fight was for Cambrai, which as far as this Company
was concerned consisted of a hunt for Huns through the ruins,
collecting souvenirs by the way. The Company had a brush with
the Bosche on the other side of the town, but they were merely
scouts left behind and pulled out as soon as fired upon. The Company
was sitting down having dinner when the English troops came
through. As there had been no barrage they did not know that the
town had been taken. From here the Company went to Valenciennes
and then on to Mons. Lieutenant Gillis was wounded at
Valenciennes and invalided to England.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <em>9th CANADIAN SIEGE BATTERY, C.E.F.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 9th Canadian Siege Battery was composed of officers
and men belonging to the Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery.
Most of the N.C.O/s and men came from Nos. 1 and 2
Companies, R.C.G.A., at Halifax, N.S. A small number came
from No. 5 Company at Esquimalt, B.C. All the officers of the
original Battery came from the strength of the R.C.G.A. at Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>For months the R.C.G.A. had been mobilized in the Forts for
the defence of Halifax; and because the defence of these Forts
was a prime necessity, and no other troops being available, it was
impossible, in the view of Headquarters, to relieve the R.C.G.A. for
service Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The possibility of an attack from German ships at first kept up
excitement, but as the War progressed this soon diminished and the
men looked down from the Forts at transport after transport bearing
troops Overseas. These were trying days for men keen themselves
to go, and it was difficult to make them believe, as they were
constantly told, that their duty was here. Volunteers for Overseas
were asked for more than once but nothing happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eventually during the summer of 1916 a definite proposal, made
by Lieut.-Col. S. A. Heward, then acting C.R.C.A. at the Citadel,
to raise a Siege Battery from the R.C.G.A. was granted, on the
understanding that men to replace those taken away should be
found and trained. This was soon done, and the Battery sailed for
England on Sept. 27, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a long delay in England the Battery was equipped with
six-inch howitzers, and landed in France on March 22nd. The subsequent
moves of the Battery after its arrival at the Front is best
set forth by the following list of Battery positions:—Mont St. Eloy—Battle
of Arras or Vimy Ridge; Hill 131 (Cabaret Rouge):
Angres; Hill 70; Frizenberg Ridge—Battle of Passchendaele;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Thelus; Calonne; Maroc; Petit Vimy; Les Tilluels; Souciiez;
Lievin; Villers Cagnicourt—Battle of Canal du Nord; Barrelle
Wood; Sauchy Lestree—Battle of Cambrai; Blecourt; Bantiguy;
Marquette; Escaudain; Wavrechain-sous-Denain—Battle of Valenciennes;
Herin; Valenciennes; St. Saulve; Onnaing; Mons.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the incessant fighting of all this period it is not known
which will be considered as major operations, but the Battle of
Arras or Vimy Ridge, Hill 70, Passchendaele, Canal du Nord,
Cambrai and Valenciennes will be considered as such as far as the
Canadian Corps is concerned, and in all of which the 9th C.S.B. did
its part.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Group Commander showed
his appreciation of the work of the Battery by a special letter of
recognition for good work done. It had been a very strenuous time.
The Battery arrived there only on April 5th. The position was in
an open muddy field. There was not much time to get ready.
Gun platforms were constructed and camouflage erected, ready to
move the guns in at night. All material, as well as the ammunition,
had to be carried a long distance. For three nights there was no
sleep, but guns were registered on April 7th and the Battery took
part in the bombardment on that and succeeding days.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Vimy the Battery moved forward to a position between
Angres and Cité du Caumont. It had a long and memorable stay
here during the protracted fighting round Lens. The position was
a very forward one for a six-inch Battery, and the Hun machine
guns at night seemed very near. Our infantry front line at first
was rather uncertain just here and German snipers and posts used
to occupy empty houses at night not very far from the Battery. It
was a good position. The guns were just behind a hill which
screened their flash and were well concealed from aeroplane observation.
The men off duty had good deep Hun dugouts, some 600
yards in rear. But the place was shelled continually.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battery had wonderful luck, shells day after day dropping
all round the guns and B. C. Post. Funk pits were soon constructed
near the guns for men to take cover when necessary. It
was during one of these enforced cessations of fire that a little
episode occurred. The No. 1, on looking out, saw an old gunner
(Gunner Forde) calmly sitting on the trail of his gun and quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>using most abusive and lurid language against the enemy. On
being asked by him why he did not obey the order to take cover,
he said, “There is not a blankety blank Hun living who will make
me take cover.” It then transpired that he had habitually stayed
behind in this manner on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the chief dangers was from splinters. In trying to get
our guns many of the Hun shells exploded on the top of the ridge
in front of them, which sent showers of splinters for 800 yards, so
that the daily relief going and coming from dugouts to guns had
an anxious time. During the stay at Angres many other batteries
came to the locality, but did not stay long, leaving for sunnier
climes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was during one of these visits that the first decoration was
awarded to the 9th C.S.B., Gunner Makin getting the M.M. for
pulling some gunners belonging to another battery out of the debris
in which they had been buried by hostile shell fire. But many
others deserved a decoration as well as he and were frequently
recommended for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In May the Battery had their most unlucky day, one chance shell
killing seven and wounding six.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in June that a Staff Officer informed the Battery that for
the time it had been in France it had (<em>a</em>) fired more rounds than
any other Battery, (<em>b</em>) had received more shelling than any other
Battery, and (<em>c</em>) was the most advanced Battery on the front.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October the Battery left Lens area for the North with the
Canadian Corps, which was to relieve the Australians in the operations
against Passchendaele. It remained in the Ypres Salient till
Dec. 13th. The Battery relieved three R.G.A. Batteries in turn,
going further forward each time. By a merciful providence the
ground was soft, and in consequence many enemy shells were
“duds”; otherwise nothing could have prevented heavy casualties.
Constant shelling and bombing; the enemy’s aeroplanes everywhere;
ours not in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ypres Salient is the abomination of desolation—one big
graveyard. A peculiarly depressing place, nothing can describe it;
it has to be felt. A complimentary letter was published from 2nd
Division describing the Heavy Artillery’s work in the taking of
Passchendaele as the “perfection of Heavy Artillery barrage.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The Battery moved South again, and for the first time in eight
months went into rest at Ham-en-Artois, arriving at that place on
Dec. 15th. It seemed almost too good to be true. Jan. 11th found
the Battery back in the line again at Petit Vimy. Then followed
uneventful moves to Calonne (Feb. 3rd) and Maroc, where there
were good cellars for the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time there was a change in Brigade Commanders.
On the new one asking the former one which was the best Battery
in the Brigade, the 9th was given a reputation it might well be
proud of.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Feb. 25th the Battery was back again at Petit Vimy position
with one section in rear near Les Tilluels. Preparation for the
expected Hun offensive was the order of the day. Successive
defensive systems were prepared. Batteries were issued with Lewis
Guns and were ordered to wire their positions. Many battery positions
were prepared and camouflaged. It was hard work for the
men who had heavy days and nights of firing to carry out at the
same time. Again the Battery found itself the most advanced in
the Brigade, and was always being called upon to fire on the most
distant target in consequence. In case of a successful Hun attack
the position would have been impossible to get out of with the steep
Vimy Ridge immediately in rear and all the roads registered and
under observation by day. It seemed that the role of the Battery,
under such circumstances, was that of a sacrifice Battery. Gradually
the infantry in front were drawn in until the line was held by
little more than machine gun posts. The field guns took up positions
behind and one woke up one night to the unusual sound of
our own field artillery shells passing over our heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The G.O.C. paid the Battery a visit after a worse than usual
“strafe,” but he found the men with their “tails up.” He said
they were doing good work and that was why they were being kept
in that position. Three distinct times was the B. C. confidentially
warned that the attack was expected on the morrow and three times
nothing unusual happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>March 21st passed and the Huns’ great attack which was to last
nine terrible days commenced. It was to the south of us, and not
till the 28th did it reach our neighborhood. But Arras remained
firm, and there was no advance worth speaking about on our front.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>At 3 a.m. the enemy started shelling the Battery with gas. He
attacked persistently with heavy gun fire till 12 noon and again in
the afternoon. At night every half hour he put down bursts of
harassing fire and concentrations, but the fire of the Battery was
kept up in spite of it and gas. The next day the enemy continued
his tactics; not a half hour but Battery, billets, roads and railway
received his attention. Two of the signallers (Dickey and West)
did noble work in repairing our telephone line, nearly a mile,
through a regular barrage of high explosive and gas, their job
being made more difficult by some defensive wire entanglements
which had been recently placed over our line.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now succeeded several months when the enemy’s chief energies
were directed to other parts of the Front, and the British Army
was recovering from its wounds, filling up its ranks and organizing
for the coming glorious advance which was to end the war.
During these months the Battery had positions at Souchez and
Lievin, neither of these being pleasant spots, but where life was
more or less normal; that is, daily and nightly tasks of firing, sometimes
counter battery shoots, sometimes destructive shoots, or
harassing fire, to all of which the Hun replied in kind. At Lievin
he gave us two bad gas bombardments, but the results, had he
known them, would have been bitterly disappointing to him, to such
an extent had we been educated by this time in anti-gas measures.
At Villers Cagnicourt Chère was some heavy firing and obstinate
fighting before the enemy was driven across the Canal du Nord.
At Barelle Wood the Battery was a day, and at Sauchy Lestree,
during the fight for Cambrai, which was very severe, several days
were spent. At this place the Huns’ night bombers were very
active.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was now moving warfare in earnest. Blecourt and
Batigny were hot places for a day or two. At Marquette and
Escaydain a night only was spent in each. Wavrechain-sous-Denain
was easy. At Herin the Battery took part in the very fine
artillery preparation for the taking of Valenciennes, and at St.
Saulve on Nov. 4th it had its last casualty of one man killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all this moving warfare, conditions were a great contrast
to the previous trench warfare. Guns sometimes took up
positions in fields almost untouched by shell-fire. The laborious gun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>pit was nearly unknown. The woods and trees were no longer shot
to pieces, and occasionally one walked into billets to find cut flowers
still fresh on the window sill, or table, left there by the retiring Hun
the day before or by its civil occupants who had been forced to leave

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <em>THE 10th SIEGE BATTERY.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The proposal to recruit a purely Nova Scotian Artillery Unit
originated when four young officers had just completed their
training with the Royal School of Artillery at Halifax.
These young officers were: Lieuts. Wm. Henry L. Doane, 1st
R.C.A.; Frederick H. Palmer, 1st R.C.A.; Robert Parker Freeman,
1st R.C.A.; Robert Edward Jamieson, 1st R.C.A.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposal was laid before Major J. M. Slayter, R.C.A.,
and after discussion he agreed to undertake to obtain the necessary
authority and to take over, at any rate temporarily, the work of
the Battery, if such was approved.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 1, 1916, authority was applied for from the General
Officer Commanding Military District No. 6 for leave to raise a
Battery of Siege in Halifax for service Overseas. On August 12,
1916, the organization of No. 10 Draft Siege Artillery Battery was
approved, and on October 1, 1916, authority was received from
headquarters for the appointment of the following officers: Major
J. M. Slayter, R.C.A. (in Command); Lieuts. Wm. H. L. Doane.
1st R.C.A.; F. H. Palmer, 1st R.C.A.; R. P. Freeman, 1st R.C.A.;
R. E. Jamieson, 1st R.C.A.</p>

<p class='c007'>Barrack accommodation was found for the proposed Battery in
South Barracks, and at once the work of active recruiting was
taken up. By the end of November, 1916, the Battery was raised
to a strength of eighty-five officers and men. Preliminary examinations
were completed and as quickly as the men completed their
preliminary training, they were passed on to Instructional Courses
to qualify as Battery Commanders, Assistants, Signalling and
Gun Laying, and all the various specialties that go to make up a
Siege Battery. On December 11, 1916, Lieut. W. H. L. Doane
was promoted to fill the vacancy of Captain in the Battery. This
completed the establishment of officers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>In accordance with orders received on December 16, 1916, Lieut.
Crosby and fifty other ranks were warned to hold themselves
in readiness to proceed Overseas. They embarked on the
<em>S.S. Scandinavian</em> on January 23, 1917. Recruiting continued
steadily and on March 26, 1917, Capt. W. H. L. Doane with fifty
other ranks proceeded Overseas on the <em>S.S. Missinabie</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. F. H. Palmer being now the senior Lieutenant of the
Battery was promoted to Captain, March 27, 1917. On April 12,
1917, Lieut. M. B. Archibald, 1st R.C.S., and Lieut. R. D. Lacon,
1st R.C.A., were appointed to the Battery. Lieut. R. P. Freeman
and fifty other ranks were warned on May 17, 1917, to hold themselves
in readiness to proceed Overseas. They sailed on the
<em>Olympic</em> on the 28th of May.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 5, 1917, warning was received that three officers
and two hundred N.C.O.’s and men would proceed Overseas. As
the Military Service Act was now about to become law, organizations
which had previously handled voluntary recruiting would
now completely change their character. Ample man power being
available, it would only be necessary to outfit and start preliminary
training of men raised under the Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of this the Draft embarked for Overseas service on
November 23, 1917, on the <em>S.S. Metagama</em>, consisting of Major
J. M. Slayter, Captain Palmer and one hundred and fifty N.C.O.’s
and men. Lieutenant Archibald and fifty other ranks proceeded
Overseas on the <em>S.S. Olympic</em>. Lieutenant Lacon, and some forty
men, the latest joined recruits, were left in Halifax to carry on the
Depot under the Military Service Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the personnel of the detachment who made up this
sailing were of an exceptionally high character, and had had considerable
training in specialties, it was hoped that they might be
retained as a Battery for service Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arrival at Witley, Surrey, England, it was found that there
were such heavy demands for reinforcements for Batteries and
Brigades already authorized, that it would be impossible to retain
the organization as it landed at Witley. Specialists were sent for
extra courses, and as these were completed were drafted very
largely to the newly-formed 10th, 11th and 12th Siege Batteries,
and to the 3rd Brigade of the C.G.A.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The Depot of the 10th Siege Battery at Halifax continued under
Major George Oland, with Lieutenant Lacon, Lieutenant McNair
and Lieutenant Baird, sending forward drafts and having raised
and equipped and sent forward some ten officers and about eight
hundred N.C.O.’s and men. The Depot at Halifax was finally
absorbed after the Armistice in the 6th Artillery Depot.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the bare facts as taken from records, which do not
signalize the splendid self-sacrificing work of such officers as
Captains W. H. L. Doane, R. P. Freeman, F. H. Palmer, and
R. E. Jamieson; and such N.C.O.’s as Jenkins, Fultz and Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>From beginning to end this Unit was marked by the high
standard of the men that it drew, the remarkable lack of crime of
even the pettiest sort, and the earnestness and whole-hearted
manner in which all ranks endeavored to qualify themselves for
their duties Overseas.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <em>17th BATTERY (6th BATTERY, C.F.A.)</em></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY WILFRED HEARN SYDNEY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The 17th Battery had the unique distinction of being the only
combatant Militia Unit in Nova Scotia to be accepted as a
Unit of the Canadian Expeditionary Force for service Overseas
in the First Canadian Contingent. On the day that war was
declared between Great Britain and Germany, the Department of
Militia and Defence wired its acceptance of Lieut.-Colonel H. G.
McLeod’s offer of the 17th Battery, C.F.A., as a Unit for service
Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mobilization of the Battery was purely a matter of selection,
for many more than the required number applied for enlistment.
On August 28, 1914, the Battery left Sydney with the full war
strength of 141 officers and men, four guns and 123 horses. The
trip to Valcartier was uneventful. Shortly after our arrival there
we were disappointed to hear that the Unit would have to be split
in order that the new war establishment of six-gun Batteries might
be completed. The right section of the 17th was to be amalgamated
with the 19th Battery from Moncton and Woodstock, while the left
section went with the 21st Battery of Westmount, Montreal. Thus
Major McLeod was to command the new 6th Battery, C.E.F., keeping
with him Capt. J. Geo. Piercey, while Capt. J. A. MacDonald,
our own “Johnnie Angus,” was lost to us, and went to the new
5th Battery in the same Brigade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two weeks spent in Valcartier Camp were pleasant. The
getting used to military routine, drill and ceremonials was not at
that early date a hardship. The novelty had not even begun to
wear off then. The reviews held by Sir Sam Hughes first and His
Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught subsequently, had a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>amount of pleasure for all of us, despite adverse weather conditions.
Yet it was not without a certain degree of impatience that we
awaited the word to set sail for England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eventually, after many false alarms, the word came, and we
donned full marching order to set out for Quebec and the waiting
transports. What a memorable sight was that Armada congregated
at Gaspe Bay! Thirty-three of our largest ocean greyhounds
in full steam, ready and anxious to hasten to the assistance of our
Mother Country in her hour of need. The order was signalled
from the flagship to set out—last letters of farewell were hurried
aboard waiting tenders, a lingering last look was taken at the
shores of Canada, and the First Canadian Contingent bade farewell
to the peaceful land of the Maple Leaf and set its gaze to the East
where lay discord and strife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ocean trips generally are never very much out of the ordinary,
and with the exception of one or two submarine scares, absolutely
without foundation, we steamed our uneventful, out-of-the-way
course to Merry England—and war. The monotony was relieved
by routine, athletic competitions and musical entertainments. It
was in the organization of the latter that the popular Canadian
composer of present times, Gitz Rice, closely related to the Cape
Breton Rices, Brent and Walter, first secured prominence in
musical circles. However, if the trip was uninspiring, such could
not be said of our reception at Plymouth. Bands playing, throngs
cheering, the shores of the city blocked with thousands of people—England
certainly did its duty that day in welcoming to its shores
her Canadian sons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disembarkation lasted a week, but finally the “Old 17th” landed
at Devonport and were soon en route for Salisbury Plains. Detrained
at Amesbury we were greeted with a downpour of rain, and
it was very little else we saw in the weather line during the whole
of our stay on that historic plain. Mud, mud, mud, and then more
mud; drill, drill, drill, and then more drill, sums up Salisbury
Plains, relieved only by brief leaves to London and provincial
towns. How we cursed the mud! Finally, however, we were
moved into comfortable quarters at Urchfont, where we enjoyed
real English hospitality and good cheer. Even the Plains had its
pleasant side, though. Our first Christmas away from home was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>spent there, and royally did Major McLeod and his fellow officers
endeavor to give us a real Christmas.</p>

<p class='c007'>We spent about a month at Urchfont before the call came for
which we had been impatiently waiting. On February 8th, 1915,
we left for France. Embarking at Avonmouth we set out for the
scene of war. The Allies at that time were being pressed from all
sides. The Bases of Calais, Boulogne, and Rouen were seriously
threatened. So it was to St. Nazair, a port in the Bay of Biscay,
that the Canadians were sent. On February 13th we first set foot
in France; on the 16th we detrained within hearing of the guns, at
Hazebrouck, marching further in to billets at Borre.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Borre the 6th Battery moved up into action and took its
first position at Fleurbaix on March 1st. The first round was fired
into the German front line by Captain Tom Kitchen, then Bombardier,
and we took it as a good omen that the second round was
observed to have sent our enemy’s field kitchen skyward. While
at Fleurbaix the Battery played its part in the mix-up of March
10th at Neuve Chapelle, and it was in this same position we underwent
our baptism of fire—fortunately with no serious casualties.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 29th, the Brigade to which the 6th Battery was
attached, was withdrawn to rest—billets at Watou. It was here, on
Easter Sunday, that the first intimation of the hardship and danger
to be expected at Ypres was given us by our Commanding Officer,
Col. J. J. Creelman. The Easter Service was conducted by Rev.
Canon Almon, and a feeling of intensity was apparent as he
impressed upon us the sad fact, that of those who heard him that
day, many would, before long, make that greatest sacrifice. And so
indeed it proved. Yet when, on April 18th, we first caught a
glimpse of the city of Ypres, then with a population of about twenty
thousand, with its shops, estaminets and business places generally
in full swing, it was hard indeed for us to believe that our padre
could be correct. Little did we foresee that in four short days this
city, beautiful, even after its first bombardment, would be a mass
of ruins, its population fleeing to safety with a miserable handful
of personal belongings, its Cathedral and historic Cloth Hall and
invaluable treasures forever lost to posterity. Yet such was to
happen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The bombardment of the Second Battle of Ypres commenced on
the 21st, and on the 22nd the Hun let loose his devilish fumes of
poison gas. The French to our left fell back, exposing our flank,
leaving a gap of over a mile. Our own boys held, but at what a
price! Reinforcements from our own reserves were hurriedly sent
up, and all that was left of our First Division was spread over the
whole of a three-mile front. But they held on for that day and the
next. On the 23rd, from our position near St. Julien, we took
part in what I firmly believe to have been the most dramatic action
that the Battery was engaged in during its stay in France and
Flanders. Our infantry had fallen back to reform for a counter-attack.
The enemy advanced after them at a range of about 1,200
yards from our guns. Two of our latter were immediately switched
to the left at an angle of 45° from their original line of fire. The
remaining two were galloped over clear country under heavy shell
fire to take up a new position.</p>

<p class='c007'>With approximately only 100 rounds of ammunition, exposed to
the heaviest shell fire, we waited until the enemy were sufficiently
advanced to come under our “open sights” so that every round
might count. So on they came until 600 yards separated us. The
order came for us to retire. This Major McLeod ignored, but
instead gave the word to open fire. The 7th Battalion charged at
the same time, with the remnants of the Kilty Brigade. Round
after round we poured into the still oncoming enemy until at last
they were held and finally swept back through Langemarck wood.
Three new positions were taken up by the Battery that night, and
finally we were settled at Indian Hill, near Wieltje, and to the side
of Potijze. What a hell-hole it was! Our casualties were fast
mounting up, both among the personnel and horses, and unfortunately
a number of these were deaths. On May 1st we took up
a position on the banks of the Yser Canal, and remained there until
the Division was withdrawn for reorganization at Hinges.</p>

<p class='c007'>On May 19th we were again, as part of the “Flying 7th
Division” hustled into hot action at Festubert, and in the following
month at Givenchy. It was at the latter place that a gun from the
6th Battery was placed in action in the front line trench, a “stunt”
subsequently acknowledged by the General Officer Commanding.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>From the “Orchard Position” at Givenchy the Old 17th was sent
into action at Neuve Eglise, where for a long time they enjoyed
comparative peace, with only occasional casualties, and nothing
more than “raiding” work, which was first commenced on this
front, to relieve the monotony. It was while here that the 2nd and
3rd Divisions came over and the Canadians became an Army Corps.
It was here, too, that we lost our Major.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major McLeod was of the type of
officer most beloved by the Canadian rank
and file. Quick, alert, a thoroughly skilled
Artillery Officer, he surely would have
forced early recognition from headquarters
had he been spared to attain it. Terrible
was the blow to his “boys,” when his
body was found in a small pond not many
rods from the gun position. His was not
even the glory of the death from bullet or
shrapnel. Yet his duty had been well done,
to his God, to his country, to his fellow
officers and men. This brief outline of the
Old 17th would be even more inadequate were the writer to omit this
humble tribute to a dear friend and beloved Commanding Officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Christmas, 1915, was spent at Neuve Eglise, and again we had
to thank our officers for providing the usual Christmas trimmings.
Conditions were not as they had been in England, and, unfortunately,
many of the old faces were missing. Such were the
fortunes of war, and we who had been raw recruits one short year
before were beginning to look at things as philosophic veterans.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter part of January the Battery was withdrawn to
Caestre for a brief rest, being relieved by one of the Units of the
2nd Division. Early in February we went to Lederzeele, and
about March 20th found ourselves in action once more at Neuve
Eglise. Just about this time rumors, hitherto vague, became more
certain that the Battery was once more to move Ypresward.
Rumor became a definite fact on April 4th, and we found ourselves
in position at Railway dugouts, a trifle to the south of Ypres City.
Here we remained in complete quiet until the 20th, when in the
Hill 60 scrap we received our first taste of gas shells.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>It was during the month of May that the organization of three
Howitzer Batteries was undertaken and sub-sections from all the
Batteries in the Division were utilized to form these Batteries, and
subsection “C” was separated from the 6th to help form the
D, 48th Battery of 4.5’s. The complete organization of this
Battery had not been consummated before the German hordes again
attacked in force, this time at Soisele Hill and Sanctuary Wood.
All sub-sections reported back to their own Batteries for duty, and
the 6th Battery again played its important part in the Third Battle of
Ypres. On the morning of June 13th the Canadians counter-attacked
and regained the ground lost in the 2nd of June scrap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the month of June was passed quietly in the
Ypres Salient, as was also the month of July, with the exception of
a little excitement at “The Dump.” About the middle of August
the Battery went into billets for rest and tactical drill at Polin Cove
and on the 26th entrained at Audruicq for the Somme.</p>

<p class='c007'>On detraining at Aix la Chateau on the 27th, the Battery, after
one day’s forced march, went into action at Mesnel on the 28th.
On September 3rd the Old 17th supported the attack of an Imperial
Corps on Thiepval, which was unsuccessful. We then moved into
position at La Boiselle on ground won from the enemy during the
fighting there in the early part of July. Glad we were to see at
long last ground won from the Hun. Seemingly we were now
engaged in driving him back, steadily and surely. The Germans
were retreating—the end of the war was in sight—so we thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>On September 15th the attack on Courcellette was commenced.
Who of us that were there can easily forget the glory of that early
sunlit September morning! The writer was fortunate enough to be
one of a party of Artillery Signallers to “go over” with the second
“wave” of infantry and was forward when the signal—dropped
from one of our air craft—came to advance. The intensity of the
bombardment was overwhelming. It was impossible to hear the
loudest shout of the man adjoining you. We were all frantic—cheering,
yelling, jumping up and down in our excitement. It was
pandemonium let loose with a vengeance—and we were winning.
We were advancing. The Sugar Refinery was reached and our
Battery was advanced. Courcellette was taken by the 25th and 26th
Battalions—and again we were moved forward until we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>practically within two hundred yards of where the German front
line had been on the morning of the 15th. This position—Pozieres
Wood—had been won by the Australians at a terrible cost some
weeks before.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the 15th until the 26th of September we were kept busy
consolidating the ground won from the enemy. On the 26th we
were again called upon to take part in a glorious action which won
Thiepval for us. We were also successful in our first attack on
Regina Trench. Such heavy action was not successfully won without
our paying the price, however, and the 6th Battery of October,
1916, little resembled the Old 17th that left Valcartier in September,
1914. Heavy had been the toll of lives and casualties.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on October 20th that the last remaining gun brought
from Sydney, was condemned after firing 20,010 rounds of ammunition.
From this on, the writer (having been wounded at the
Somme sufficiently to keep him out of action for the remainder of
the war) must depend, not on personal observation, but on information
derived from divers sources.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in November Desire Support Trench was taken, and a
little later on in the same month our wagon lines were again
situated at Albert. The march along Bouzincourt, Varennes,
Raincheva, Frevent, St. Pol, St. Michel and Marquay was uneventful.
On the 30th the Battery stopped at Pernes, for a well-earned
rest. Our 1916 Christmas dinner was held here, and mighty
well was it celebrated. On January 6th we started out for Bruay,
Ruitz, Hersin to Fosse 10 and finally into action at Bully Grenay.</p>

<p class='c007'>On February 13th the first landing of the Canadians in France
was suitably celebrated at noon, by the firing of “Battery cheers”
and “Brigade cheers.” From then on is merely a series of names,
Hersin Wagon Lines, Maisnil-les-Ruitz, Camblain l’Abbe, until the
E2 position behind Neuville St. Vaast. On the 25th the Battery
was again changed from a four to a six-gun Unit. From Neuville
St. Vaast the Old 17th went to Vimy. Who will forget Bentata
Tunnel? Who will forget the morning of the 13th when two
guns of the old Battery went to form the composite Battery at
Bois Carre, to the right of Thelus? On the night of the 16th the
Battery went over the Ridge, and from there on the story of the
6th is the same as that of the other Nova Scotia Units that took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>part at Vimy. From Vimy to late in July was uneventful. On
the 22nd of that month our wagon lines were established at Les
Brebis. On the 23rd we went into action behind Loos Crassier.
Things remained quiet until August 15th when the Hill 70 scrap
for Lens commenced. On September 9th we were at Lievin, and
remained in that vicinity for about one month.</p>

<p class='c007'>Around October 1st a move was made to Boyeffles, where the
wagon line was established. On the 6th the Battery took up a
position behind the cemetery at Lievin, where we remained for
some time. On the 24th of October we were again en route for
Ypres, our old hunting ground, via Bethune, Morbecque and Godewaersvelde.
On the 29th our wagon lines were settled at a spot
just south of St. Julien, and on the 1st of November we took up a
position, which shall ever be consecrated in memory of our First
Canadian Contingent, for the Passchendaele show. On the 23rd
we were again en route south, via Bailleul, Strazeele, Haverskerque
and Vendin-les-Bethune. On November 26th the Battery was again
at the Old Lievin cemetery. Christmas Day, 1917, was celebrated
at Haillicourt.</p>

<p class='c007'>On January 24th the Battery took up a position behind Loos
Crassier, where they remained in comparative quietness until March
22nd, when a new position behind the double Crassier was taken.
On the 29th we went into action at Ronville Dump between Arras
and Achicourt, and from there to the Old Mill at Achicourt on
April 1st. On the 8th we were out at Anzin, on the 9th at
Musketry Valley position, in front of St. Laurent Blangy. The
Battery was withdrawn for rest at Hermanville on May 25th, and
on June 1st was inspected with the other Batteries in the Brigade
by the Corps Commander. On the 10th Divisional Sports were
held, in which the old Battery won its quota of prizes.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 15th we went into action at St. Laurent Blangy, and
on the 24th were back again at Achicourt—Old Windmill position.
August the 1st saw the Unit at Berlincourt, and on the 3rd they
entrained at Frevent for Amiens. We detrained the following day
at Prouzel and left for Bois de Boves. On August 5th we took up
a position at Bois de Gentelles, and on the 8th took part in the
“kick off” for the Amiens show with a night position in front of
Cayeux. From the 9th until the 16th is simply a sequence of names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that spells the hardest action; Caix Valley, Warvillers, Le Quesnoy,
Warvillers. On August 21st the Battery was en route back to
Saleux, via Cayeux, Domart and Boves Wood, where they entrained
for Aubigny and Dainville Wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “kick off” for the Drocourt-Queant line came on September
2nd. On the 3rd our position was taken up just east of
Villers Cagnicourt, and on the 6th the 6th Battery was at Bainville
on rest, where they remained for about three weeks. On the 26th
the Battery went into action at Buissy, and on the 27th took part in
the attack on Canal du Nord and Cambrai. The Old 17th had the
honor to be the first Battery to cross the Canal at Inchy, and
immediately after took up position just east of the Canal beyond
Inchy.</p>

<p class='c007'>October was merely a repetition of names. The Battery took
part in the general rout of the enemy, until November 7th found
them at Crespin, in action for the last time. On November the
10th the last round was fired from the Battery in this position by
Gunner Malcolm MacDonald of “B” subsection, the very same
subsection that fired the first round on March 1, 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 11 a.m. of November 11th hostilities ceased and the fighting
was finished. The “Old 17th,” however, marched into Germany
as part of the Army of Occupation and completed the work that
the original had set out to do. Very few, however, of the original
members were left by that time. Yet those of us, who were unable
to share in the glorious hour of Victory, were recompensed by
knowing that our successors nobly carried on in our places equally
as well as, if not better than, we ourselves could have done. The
Battery embarked at Southampton on <em>S.S. Olympic</em>, and arrived at
Halifax on April 21, 1919. It was demobilized the same day and
consequently its home city, Sydney, was deprived of the pleasure of
welcoming it as a Unit.</p>

<p>LT.-COL. T. M. SEELEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In November, 1914, Lieut.-Col. T. M. Seeley, of Yarmouth, N.S.
(O.C. 11th Brigade, C.F.A.), was commissioned to organize the
23rd Battery of Field Artillery, to represent the Maritime
Provinces in the 6th Artillery Brigade, C.E.F. The temporary
headquarters were at Fredericton, N.B., but recruits were to be
drawn from any part of the Maritime Provinces. Many were
furnished by the 3rd, 4th and 11th
Brigades of the Militia Artillery. An
important factor in the new Unit was
a group of twenty-five or thirty students
who joined from the University of New
Brunswick and other universities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recruiting proceeded at such a
rate that Lieut.-Col. Seeley soon found
himself with fifty or sixty men over
strength. He appealed to headquarters
for authority to have a second Battery
formed, which was granted. Lieut.-Col.
B. A. Ingraham, R.O., of Sydney, C.B.,
was commissioned to organize the 24th Battery, also at Fredericton.
He took over the surplus from the 23rd, and in addition
brought a large detachment of fine men from Cape Breton.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Batteries trained side by side until February 18, 1915,
when they were mobilized with the 21st Battery of Kingston and
the 22nd Battery of Montreal, and sent Overseas February 22nd
on <em>S.S. Megantic</em>, under Lieut.-Col. E. W. Rathburn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mayor of Fredericton, the Premier of New Brunswick, the
Earl and Countess of Ashburnham, and the citizens generally were
very kind to the artillerymen during their sojourn in Fredericton.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Just previous to sailing there were several changes made in the
personnel of the officers. Lieut.-Colonel Seeley was detailed to
organization duty in Canada, and Major J. K. MacKay was placed in
command of the 23rd Battery. On sailing the staff was: Major
MacKay, O.C.; Capt. E. A. Chisholm; Lieuts. J. E. Read and
J. N. McEachern. The Staff of the 24th Battery was: Lieut.-Colonel
Ingraham, O.C.; Capt. A. T. MacKay (of P.E.I.); Lieuts.
G. St. C. A. Perrin and O. Mowatt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arriving in England the Batteries received a brief training at
Shorncliffe, after which they were drafted to the Second Brigade,
C.F.A., and Divisional Ammunition Column in France. A large
proportion of the N.C.O.’s and men of these Batteries won commissions
and distinctions on the field.</p>

<p>MAJ. D. A. MACKINNON D. S. O.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The 36th Battery was formed in Sydney in September, 1915,
Major Walter Crowe being the organizer and leading spirit
in it. The rush of applications for positions in the Battery
was so great that over one hundred had to be turned away. Major
Crowe selected his men with great care; and the subsequent
achievements of the Battery is evidence that his judgment was
good. To Major Crowe must be given
a great deal of credit for the splendid
record which the Battery achieved Overseas.
He remained with it as its Commanding
Officer and supervised nearly
all its early training, took it Overseas in
March, 1916, but on account of being
very much over age could not accompany
the Battery to France; so the
command was given to Major D. A.
MacKinnon, of Charlottetown, P.E.I.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battery arrived in France on
July 14th, 1916, and was almost immediately
placed in action on the Ypres Salient, which was a very
“hot” spot. They were in action only twenty-four hours when they
received quite a heavy shelling from the enemy. They remained in
this position for about a month, firing day and night, and their quick
response to all calls from the infantry was remarked upon. The
next move was to Kemmel, which was a nice quiet spot, and the
boys enjoyed themselves very much while in that vicinity. Early
in October the march for the Somme commenced. It occupied a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>week; and about the 12th of October the Battery went into action
about one thousand yards in the rear of Courcellette. They received
considerable shelling but returned one hundred rounds for every
one they got. After the Battle of Regina Trench they moved
forward in front of Martinpuich, with the expectation of another
great battle which never materialized. While in this position they
were constantly shelled, the discomforts were terrible, mud and
rain preventing any kind of decent accommodation; but the gunners
were better off than the drivers at the wagon lines; there the mud
was two feet deep, and the trials and sufferings almost unendurable.
Nearly all the ammunition had to be carried to the guns by packing
it on horses’ and mules’ backs, taking it up over trails, inasmuch as
the roads were death traps, on account of enemy fire. Notwithstanding
this the Battery kept up its reputation for activity, having
fired on several occasions well over one thousand rounds in a few
hours. They were highly complimented for their splendid concealment
and for the brave way in which they carried on under very
discouraging difficulties. On the 20th of November the Division
pulled out of the Somme, greatly to the relief of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week’s tramp to the Ecuri Front commenced, the first two
days being teeming rain and bitter cold. It was during this march
that Sergt. Sam Wilson, one of the most popular men in the
Battery, contracted pneumonia and died in a few days, mourned by
all. During the following months the Battery stayed in position
doing garrison duty, but in February they were forced to leave
and made three shifts of positions in three days. The bitter cold,
it being the coldest winter in forty years, and the shortage of fodder
for the horses, coupled with the hard work which so much moving
entailed, caused the death of a great many horses and mules. The
hardships of the drivers were also particularly severe, shelter was
at a premium, and the winter of 1916 and 1917 will ever remain as
a very disagreeable memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in March preparations commenced for the Battle of Vimy
Ridge, the drivers being constantly employed at night hauling vast
quantities of ammunition to forward points. The month was very
rainy with high winds, and all night the men would be exposed to
the rain and winds and return at daybreak tired and exhausted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>cold and wet to the skin. The sufferings which they experienced
that winter, and the grim determination with which they carried
through their duties will never be forgotten. On the 25th of March
the 36th was changed to a six-gun Battery, absorbing one-half of
the 29th Battery. It was a splendid consolidation, the newcomers
proving very excellent gunners and drivers, and brave men. About
the 1st of April, 1917, the Battery moved forward to a little
hollow near the Arras road, facing Vimy Ridge. Rude pits had
to be constructed for the guns, and these they soon fashioned into
a home for the Battery. The Batteries were as thick as flies in
this hollow, and we had neighbors on all sides of us. The 2nd of
April saw everybody registering on targets in the enemy lines, and
one had almost to crawl about to prevent being hit by our own guns.
As the enemy had observation of this position they very quickly
began to use it, shelling the area with gas and high explosives. It
was a most uncomfortable position, and had the battle been delayed
a few days longer and the enemy been given a chance to get more
heavy artillery, there is no doubt that they would have given us a
bad time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battle of Vimy Ridge started at 5 o’clock, April 9th. It was
the biggest battle we had ever been engaged in, and every one was
quite interested to see how it would pan out. It was a great success,
and we quickly got orders to move our position forward so as to be
able to range on the retreating enemy. This was accomplished very
speedily. The battle practically ended on April 10th, and no
further move was made forward. On the 14th we took our guns
down into the village of Vimy being, we believed, one of the first
Batteries to enter that much shelled village. We were lucky in getting
in and lucky in getting our teams out, as the roads were shelled
most terrifically. It was three weeks after that before we could
bring a wagon of any description down the roads to the Battery.
All ammunition and supplies had to be brought on pack horses and
mules along trails leading over the ridges, but by the exercise of
great care they managed to keep up our ammunition supplies and
prevent casualties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first two weeks which followed in our position were memorable
for the amount of gas which the enemy hurled at us. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>wore our masks practically all night. Thanks to a sufficient gas
drill and gas protection our casualties were slight. With the energy
and resource which characterized our boys they set to work and
built a position which was the envy of all. It was so constructed
that it was impossible to detect it by aeroplane or other observation.
Speaking tubes connected all the gun-pits with the command post,
and each pit had a tunnel leading into the other; so that if one was
severely bombarded, an escape could be made through the other.
The walls of the pits were nicely decorated with captured German
material, and the appearance was such as to strike an inspecting
officer most favorably. The greatest attention was paid to
strengthening each defence, as the shelling was intense both by day
and night. It was lucky that all these precautions were taken; for
on the 24th of June, just as the Battery had completed firing a trial
barrage, the enemy opened up with four batteries of heavy artillery.
The bombardment was terrific, and almost all varieties of shell
were used, including armor-piercing shell, which went down ten
feet in the ground and then exploded. It was marvelous that there
was anything left of the Battery, the whole position was covered
with shell holes. One of the shells passed through the shelter in
which Corpl. John McVicar, of Sydney, was with his gun detachment.
The shock instantly killed Corporal McVicar and dazed some
of the others. At the same time others had become casualties. The
day will be long remembered as one which inflicted great sorrow on
the remaining members of the Battery. While we were in this
position Corporal Jack and Gunner Wheatley were also wounded,
and there were several regrettable casualties among the drivers at
the wagon lines.</p>
<div  class='figright id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>CAPT. F. H. TINGLEY, M.C.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Early in July the Battery moved to a forward position near
Vimy and, while there, was subjected to another terrific bombardment
in which they had nearly one thousand rounds of ammunition
destroyed. Several of the officers had close calls, and those who
are alive will never forget the experience. About the 31st of July
the Battery moved to Hill 70, and took up a position behind the
double crassier. They constructed a good position in a very short
time. The place was alive with Canadian Field Batteries, and it
did not take the Hun long to discover the fact. Nearly all the
Batteries were silent; that is, they were not to do any firing until
a battle commenced, but the 36th and a few others were selected to
do all the firing, including the heavy task of demolishing the wire
in the German trenches, so that our infantry could get through.
This the Battery did to the entire satisfaction of the infantry,
although it was at quite a heavy cost to themselves, as they were
constantly shelled day and night, and the
position was a most trying one. The
battle, which took place about the 14th
of August, was one of the bloodiest of
the whole war. The Hill was the key to
Lens, and the Hun determined to retake
it at all costs. In one day there were
fourteen counter attacks made by the
Hun, and on every occasion the field
artillery responded, instantly killing
many thousands of Germans. The work
of the 36th throughout this engagement
was commented on and needs no mention
here. In one day they brought up from the ammunition dump
and fired over five thousand rounds of ammunition. For two weeks
the gunners had practically no rest, while the drivers that could be
spared from the wagon lines came up and assisted in getting
ammunition ready. So active had the Battery become that the
Hun determined to destroy it and made several attempts but without
success. However on the night of the 24th of August, while
the Battery was firing an S.O.S., in response to a call from the
infantry, they were subjected to a very intense shelling with a new
gas, afterwards known as mustard gas. This gas is very much of
the nature of sulphuric acid, and the burns made by it are very
similar. In a short time several men were struck by the shells,
some wounded and some killed; others going to the assistance of
their suffering comrades got the gas on their hands and were
terribly burned. It was an awful night, and some very gallant deeds
were done. The returns next day showed three killed, three officers
and twenty-five others gassed. Some of the men who were gassed
on that occasion never recovered from it. The effects will be with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>them as long as they live. It was a very bad night for the Canadian
Artillery. Other Batteries suffered, some even more severely,
but they received unstinted praise for the gallant way they stuck
to their guns. Besides the above, the Battery suffered a great many
other casualties while in the Hill 70 Sector. In addition to Lieutenants
Teed and Fleet being gassed, Lieutenant Longworth was
severely wounded. On the night of the 29th of August we were
relieved by a British Battery, but the relief could not be completed
in quiet, the Hun shelling the position very severely with gas.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were all pleased to leave that vicinity, and our next position
was on the Vimy Front, which was nice and quiet; and everybody
had a very pleasant time until the 10th of October, when the
Canadian Corps marched to Passchendaele, a trek that was undertaken
with anything but light hearts, for its reputation as a death
trap was known to all. On the 21st of October we took over
from an English Battery, who were in a very bad way, having been
practically shot to pieces. Everything was in very bad shape, only
two guns being in action; but with great courage the boys set to
work and very soon had the best position in the Salient. They
protected their guns and themselves by the use of sand bags; and
in that way saved many valuable lives. Conditions were such as
to be almost impossible of description. The mud was up to one’s
knees, and the place seemed to be nothing but shell holes filled with
water. The enemy had perfect observation on us from the village
of Passchendaele. On the 24th of October we registered our guns
on its church, and the battle started on the 26th. During the
progress of the battle we were severely shelled, Gunner Ira
Stewart, of Charlottetown, being instantly killed. All the gunners
carried on very heroically notwithstanding the shelling, and the day
ended with a great victory for the Canadians.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later we had moved forward to a position in front
of Kansas Cross, and in a short time had prepared a very fine
position considering the materials at hand. The artillery programme
was a very extensive one, firing starting at 5 o’clock in the morning
and continuing at intervals several times through the day and night.
The daily expenditure of the Battery ran well over one thousand
rounds, and this had to be transported by pack mules a distance of
eight miles from the ammunition dump. While on their way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the guns they were subjected to scattered shelling and to bombing
by overhead planes. At night they got no rest either at the guns,
or the wagon lines, heavy bombing planes circling over the area
and dropping their contents indiscriminately. The casualties of
the Canadians in these terrible battles are well known, their sufferings
are beyond description. No words of mine can adequately
portray the courage, fortitude, cheerfulness and devotion to duty
exemplified by the officers and men of the 36th Battery in the
terrible battles which culminated in the capture of Passchendaele
Ridge. Among the officers it would be unfair to particularize, for
all did their part nobly; but I believe that I could speak of Lieut.
Andrew Livingstone’s three weeks’ experience as a forward officer
as being the most awful of the lot. Words could not picture the
things he saw and what he went through. To Lieut. Chas. Shrieve,
of Digby, I always gave the greatest credit for the resourcefulness
he displayed in building the positions. For his gallant conduct he
was awarded the Military Cross. Lieutenant Teed had previously
received the same decoration for similar conduct at Hill 70.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 14th of November the most awful experience the Battery
ever had was encountered. The night before the enemy had
attempted a counter attack but the signal from the infantry had
met with such instant response from the field artillery that his ranks
were practically decimated. In retaliation he turned every gun he
could command on the Batteries of field artillery in front of Kansas
Cross. There were probably twenty English and Canadian Batteries
within an area of three hundred yards; and on these at 1.30
in the afternoon was placed a bombardment that for intensity has
probably never been excelled. Guns and ammunition were blown
up at every volley, one entire Battery being wiped out, with all its
personnel. The 36th received their share of the shelling, their
dugouts being blown up and the gunners and officers buried beneath
them. They had, however, suffered very few casualties considering
the terrible ordeal passed through; but those who were placed at
the guns on that day will never forget the experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 21st of November they moved out of Passchendaele,
the Hun shelling the position just as they were leaving, and the
succeeding Battery being practically annihilated within a few days.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>A period of recuperation ensued, which did much to recover the
morale of the Battery. In January they moved down into the Vimy
Front, suffering the ordinary run of casualties, but without any
very serious troubles. On the 21st of March, 1918, the Hun put
on his famous offensive, and it was feared that he would attempt
to take Vimy Ridge. As there was very little chance of getting
the guns out if he broke through our infantry lines, it was decided
to move the Batteries from the plain to the top of the Ridge, where
they were put for defensive purposes. The 36th Battery was
selected as a sacrifice Battery and were left in their position in front
of Vimy. Their task was to harass the enemy as much as possible,
their daily expenditure of ammunition running from a thousand to
two thousand rounds. This activity of one Battery did not escape
the alert attention of the Hun; and on the 28th of March, when he
made his famous attack on Arras, a little to the south of Vimy, he
took on the 36th Battery in great style. In three hours it was
estimated by observers on the Ridge that over two thousand-rounds
were fired into the Battery. Guns and dugouts were blown up and
a tremendous lot of damage done. Some brave deeds were carried
out by members of the Battery, and among the decorations received
for this affair were Military Medals by Sergeant Cashen, of Sydney,
and Signaller MacKenzie and Bombardier Peter Laforte. All the
members of the Battery acted most heroically. That night orders
were given to retire the Battery from this untenable position, and
in the new one they carried on with much more comfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the 1st of May the Battery went into training for open
warfare, and remained in training until July when they went into
the line for a few weeks. On the 28th of July they were drawn
from the line, and on the first of August started on the famous
march to Amiens. The greatest secrecy was maintained regarding
the destination of the Canadians, and it was not until the night of
the 4th of August that we knew our destination. The nights of the
5th, 6th and 7th were utilized in bringing up thousands of rounds
of ammunition and getting ready for the big battle which started
on the 8th. The Battle of Amiens was the hand-writing on the
wall, so General Ludendorff has told us. On that day the 36th Battery
occupied six positions, giving the most splendid aid to our glorious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>infantry. At half past four in the afternoon a German aeroplane
swooped down on the Battery and killed several horses, wounded
some of the men and Lieutenant Manning. The casualties would
have been greater but for the bravery and coolness of the machine
gunners, who poured a constant volley into the Hun and actually
killed him, his plane crashing in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battle of Amiens continued for several days with constant
advances. On the night of the 13th we were ordered to place
three thousand rounds of ammunition in an advanced position for
another Battery. Sergt. J. W. Boutillier was given charge of the
unloading. While waiting for the arrival of the ammunition his
party was subjected to heavy shell fire. Sergeant Boutillier and
Sergeant Swift were killed and several others were wounded.
Sergeant Boutillier was one of the most outstanding men in the
entire Battery and his loss was very keenly felt. For his bravery
on this occasion Corpl. A. J. McGillivary was awarded the Croix
de Guerre.</p>

<p>LIEUT. D. L. TEED, M.C.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On the 19th of August the Battery started on its march for the
Battle of Arras, arriving at Arras on the night of the 23rd of
August and going into position that same night. The night of the
24th was utilized in bringing up ammunition. On the 25th they
rested. On the morning of the 26th the famous Battle of Arras
opened. It was a day full of stirring incidents, the 36th Battery
suffered severe casualties. The following days were very busy,
the Battery constantly moving into new positions, shelling the
enemy, and being shelled in return. On the morning of September
1st orders were received to cut wire on the Hindenburg line, and
to expend upwards of four thousand rounds for that purpose.
The position which the 36th Battery occupied was a very exposed
one, and under observation by balloons and other means. The
Battery had about completed one task when the enemy started to
shell us very severely. At first the rounds fell short. Lieutenant
Teed was at the telephone, and thinking that I did not receive the
orders at the guns ran down to shout an order to No. 2 gun in charge
of Sergeant McKay. Just as he got there an enemy shell landed,
instantly killing Sergeant McKay, Gunner John Cornfoot and Lieutenant
Teed. These were three of our very best, and the blow was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>one of the saddest in the 36th Battery’s whole experience. Lieut.
Lionel Teed was from St. John, and had been with the Battery
from its commencement. He was a brave officer, an extremely
clever one, and loved by all. Sergeant McKay and Jack Cornfoot
were also very popular. The wire cutting was completed. Notwithstanding
the shelling the brave boys of the 36th carried
on as though nothing had happened.
The battle which took place the next
day broke the Hindenburg line, the
strongest trench fortification ever utilized
in warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>A succession of moves forward was
then made. The Batteries kept close
behind the infantry in their pursuit of
the Hun. On the 14th a halt was made,
and the Batteries transferred to another
section of the Front. They took up a
position in the village of Sudemont,
which was a very “hot” place, being
almost constantly under shell fire. A number of casualties occurred
when we were in this position, notably Corpl. John McSween, who
lost a leg, and Sergeant Philpott and others. On the 17th the
Battery started for the Battle of Cambrai, arriving in that sector on
the evening of the 18th. The nights of the 19th and 20th were used
in bringing up ammunition to a position in the little town of Inchy,
where a battery position had been selected. The ammunition could
only be drawn up under the greatest difficulties, for the roads were
under heavy shell fire. Some very gallant deeds were done by the
drivers and those in charge of them. For one particularly gallant
exploit Corpl. A. Morrison received the D.C.M.</p>

<p>CAPT. CHAS. D. SHRIEVE, M.C.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The morning of the 21st was beautiful and the battle was
wonderfully successful. Before ten o’clock thousands of yards of
enemy territory had been penetrated and Bourlon Wood captured.
The enemy field artillery recovered and shelled us vigorously, and
we suffered several casualties. The battle continued for several
days, with constant gain of territory for us. On the night of the
28th, while Lieutenant Livingstone was unloading ammunition, his
drivers and the gunners were subjected to heavy shell fire and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>had many regrettable casualties; among the drivers, Frank Hughes,
of Charlottetown, and Driver George McDonald, of Sydney.
George was one of the most wonderful guides in France, and his
loss was a severe one. The next few days saw several moves of
positions, and on the 5th of October the 36th Battery was in a
position at Raillencourt. On the evening of October 7th orders
were issued for the Battery to move up
to a position in the rear of St. Olle.
The six guns with ammunition and
ammunition wagons arrived at the position
and were starting to unlimber when
a volley of German shells landed directly
in them. The casualties were terrific,
over 50 per cent. of those present being
killed or wounded together with twenty
horses. The whole thing occupied only
a few minutes, but it saddened a great
many hearts. Lieut. Chas. Shrieve was
shot through the chest and died instantly.
Captain Craig was severely wounded through the hip. Lieutenant
Livingstone was wounded in two places and his ankle broken.
Twenty-eight N.C.O.’s and men were killed or wounded. Among
the killed was the very popular Bombardier John Drysdale. The
blow was a demoralizing one, but the undaunted courage of the
remaining members of the 36th was equal to the task. Within
three hours the guns had been transferred to new positions, and
lines of fire laid out, and the Battery ready for action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hill 70 gas episode and the shelling received the night of
October the 7th were two of the worst experiences that any
Battery had ever been called upon to endure, but the brave boys of
the 36th met both with unflinching courage and proved themselves
worthy of all the encomiums which had been bestowed upon them.
For gallant work on this occasion several members of the Battery
were decorated. On the 10th of October Cambrai was captured,
the 36th Battery doing its share to make the battle a success.</p>

<p>LT. F. J. LONGWORTH, M.C.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>From Cambrai they moved northward again, occupying various
positions with various degrees of fortune until November 1st, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the march towards Mons commenced. This was one long succession
of triumphs, culminating in the capture of the celebrated
city on the morning of the 11th of November. On the afternoon
of the 10th we were in position at Je-Mappes, about one thousand
yards from Mons. At 3.30 in the afternoon orders were received
to fire on the railway at Mons, and while engaged in doing that
several enemy shells were fired into the
Battery, one of which instantly killed
Lieut. Fred Longworth, of Charlottetown,
and wounded Sergeant Dickson
and several others. Sergeant Dickson
received thirty-two wounds but managed
to pull through. On the morning of the
11th at 6.30 word was received that the
Armistice was signed, and a March-Past
was ordered to take place in the City of
Mons. There was great rejoicing at the
good news, inasmuch as the suffering of
the last three months was beginning to
tell on the remaining members of the “Old Guard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot close this account of the doings of the 36th Battery
without making reference to the wonderful qualities which the
officers, N.C.O.’s and men displayed. It was easy to command a
Battery like the 36th. They were everything that could be desired.
Loyal, brave and good-humored, with the greatest devotion to duty,
they cannot be too highly praised by me. Every man was a hero
and every man deserved decorations many times over. I feel that
it is but fitting that I should here mention the fact, when speaking
about decorations, that the 36th Battery received a very large share
of them, including one D.S.O., two Croix de Guerre, eight Military
Crosses, one bar for Military Cross, ten D.C.M.’s and twenty
Military Medals.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 21, 1918, Major D. A. MacKinnon, who commanded
the 36th Battery from its arrival in France on July 14,
1916, and who took part with the Battery in all its battles, was
granted sick leave to Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The loss of so many brave officers and brave men had been a
severe shock to him, and his nerves became greatly unstrung. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>was with sincere regret that he parted with the boys after nearly
three years of strenuous fighting. The Battery, after a short stay
in Belgium, was transferred to England, demobilizing in March,
1919. On the 36th Battery’s return to Sydney, N.S., they were
tendered a most notable reception.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LT.-COL. J. L. M‘KINNON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 14th Brigade, C.F.A., was organized in the spring of
1916 and was part of the 4th Division Artillery, which
trained at Petawawa in the summer of 1916. The 14th
Brigade, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel John L. McKinnon,
of Halifax, N.S., was composed of the following Units: Headquarters,
7 officers, 40 men, recruited in Nova Scotia. Batteries,
55th and 56th, recruited in Guelph, Ont.;
58th, recruited in New Brunswick; 66th,
recruited in Montreal. Brigade Ammunition
Column, 3 officers, 120 men, recruited
in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the O.C., Lieutenant-Colonel
McKinnon, the following other
Nova Scotia officers proceeded Overseas
with this Brigade: Capt. G. C.
Oland, Halifax, Adjutant; Capt. C. V.
Trites, Liverpool, Medical Officer, both
attached to Brigade Headquarters;
Major S. C. Oland, in command of 66th
Battery; Lieut. J. Vickery, 58th Battery; Brigade Ammunition
Column, Capt. F. S. Burns, Lieut. Herbert Stairs, Lieut. W. M.
Ray, Lieut. T. D. Farquahar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 4th Divisional Artillery, consisting of the 12th, 13th, 14th
and 15th Brigades, and Divisional Ammunition Column, left Canada
on September 11, 1916, and completed training in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fall of 1916 the Imperial authorities for the Imperial
Army adopted the formation of six-gun Batteries instead of four-gun
Batteries, reducing Brigades in each Division. The Canadian
authorities followed in January, 1917, and from the 1st, 2nd and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>3rd Divisions in France a new 4th Divisional Artillery was reconstituted,
and the old 4th Divisional Artillery became 5th Divisional
Artillery, which later became Corps Artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the formation of the Nova Scotia Regimental Depot, Lieutenant-Colonel
McKinnon was given command and was later
appointed Deputy Judge Advocate General, Canadian Forces Overseas.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <em>THE ROYAL CANADIAN REGIMENT.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The Royal Canadian Regiment was raised on December 21,
1883, as a Unit of the new Canadian Permanent Force, for
the instruction of the Canadian Militia by establishing
schools of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers,
and by the formation of a nucleus of officers and non-commissioned
officer instructors to assist at the various Militia Camps. The
Regiment was first known as the “Infantry School Corps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1885 “C” Company, stationed at Toronto, joined a mixed
force of Militia under the command of Lieut.-Col. W. D. Otter,
which marched across the ice along the North Shore of Lake
Superior to the Northwest, to suppress the rebellion of the half-breeds,
under the leadership of Louis Riel. The Company took
part in the action of Fish Creek and the relief of Battleford on
April 24th, and in the action of Cut Knife Hill on May 2nd.
It also took part in the pursuit of Chief Big Bear during June and
July. It remained in garrison at Battleford from July until
October, when it returned to Toronto. This was the first occasion
on which Canadian troops had conducted active operations and
brought them to a successful conclusion without the aid of Imperial
troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1892 the name of the Regiment was changed to the “Canadian
Regiment Infantry,” and the following year Queen Victoria
approved of the Regiment becoming a Royal Regiment, known as
the “Royal Canadian Regiment of Canadian Infantry,” and granted
permission for her Imperial Cypher, V.R.I., with the Imperial
Crown, to be worn as a badge.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1899, on the outbreak of the South African War, a second
(Special Service) Battalion was raised under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel W. D. Otter, and sailed on October 30, 1899, in the
<em>S.S. Sardinian</em>, arriving at Cape Town on November 30th. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>addition to minor skirmishes the Battalion took part in the following
actions while in South Africa:</p>

<p class='c007'>The casualties in South Africa were thirty-nine killed, twenty-eight
died of disease, one hundred and twenty-three wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was represented at the annexation ceremony at
Pretoria on October 25th by a party specially selected, and on
November 7th it embarked at Cape Town for Southampton, arriving
on November 29th. The Battalion was inspected by Her
Majesty Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, when she addressed
them and thanked them for their services. This was the last official
inspection made by the Queen before her death.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 11th the Battalion embarked at Liverpool and
sailed for Canada, arriving at Halifax on December 23rd, where it
was disbanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the South African War the name of the Regiment was
changed to the “Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry.” His
Majesty King George, then Duke of York, presented colors to the
Regiment at Toronto on October 11, 1901, during his tour of the
British Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>A 3rd (Garrison) Battalion of the Regiment was raised at
Halifax to release the 1st Battalion Leinster Regiment (Royal
Canadians) for service elsewhere. This Battalion was brought to
a high state of efficiency and formed the greater part of the Garrison
in the Fortress at Halifax. It was, however, disbanded shortly
after being relieved by an Imperial Regiment, the 5th Battalion
Royal Garrison Regiment, in September, 1902.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1902 the name of the Regiment was once again changed, becoming
known by its present distinctive title of “The Royal Canadian
Regiment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1904, a special banner, given by His Majesty King Edward
VII to commemorate the Regiment’s services in South Africa, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>presented at Ottawa on October 4th by His Excellency the
Governor-General, Lord Minto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imperial troops having been withdrawn and the defence of
Canada taken over by local troops, the Regiment moved to Halifax,
the establishment being raised to ten companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the outbreak of the European War in August, 1914, the
Regiment was mobilized at Halifax, occupying the various forts.
It was brought up to war strength by a draft of four hundred
volunteers, men from the newly formed Camp at Valcartier, for
the Expeditionary Force then being raised. Being trained regular
troops, and the only ones available for service Overseas, the Regiment,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel A. O. Fages, was sent
to Bermuda on September 9th to relieve the 2nd Battalion Lincolnshire
Regiment, and were the first Canadian troops to go abroad.
In August of the following year, the Regiment having been relieved
by the 38th Battalion, C.E.F., proceeded, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Carpenter, to France, via England, where it was rearmed
and re-equipped. It landed at Boulogne, under the command
of Lieut.-Col. A. H. Macdonell, D.S.O., on October 31st, and on
moving up the line immediately became Corps Troops to the Canadian
Corps under Lieut.-General Sir A. E. H. Alderson, K.C.B. It
went into the trenches for the first time with the First Canadian
Division, opposite Messines.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of 1916 it was one of the Battalions composing
the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade under Brigadier-General A. C.
Macdonell, C.M.G., D.S.O., of the newly formed 3rd Canadian
Division, under Major-General Mercer, C.B. The Brigade consisted
of the Royal Canadian Regiment, Princess Patricia’s Canadian
Light Infantry, 42nd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada)
and 49th Battalion (Edmonton Regiment), and, later, the 7th
Canadian Machine Gun Company. The Regiment went into the
line with the Brigade at Wulvergham, moving afterward to
Kemmel and then to Ypres.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Regiment’s first general action was that of the German
attack on June 2nd to June 5th on Sanctuary Wood and Hooge, in
the Ypres Salient. Here the Regiment, under Lieut.-Col. C. H.
Hill, distinguished itself by its steadiness under the heaviest concentration
of hostile artillery and trench mortar fire which up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that date had ever been brought to bear on British troops. By its
rifle and machine gun fire the attempted infantry assaults against
its lines were frustrated, and it was virtually the action of the
machine guns, assisted by the 7th Canadian Machine Gun Company,
that prevented a great disaster to the whole Ypres Salient. These
guns had been unable to get away after being relieved on account
of dawn breaking. On June 5th the Germans blew up three very
large mines at Hooge, annihilating the Garrison. The guns, which
were some distance in the rear, immediately mounted, fully exposed,
on the Menin Road, and by their coolly directed fire threw back the
German Infantry, thus preventing them from swamping our line
and outflanking it both north and south on the Menin Road. The
action of June 2nd to 5th exemplified the value of long training.
The older men who had been in the Regiment for years, and who
were considered as almost past their day, came to the fore wonderfully
by their steadiness and discipline. This was shown particularly
when during the hostile infantry attacks and intense shelling they
remained cool and steady and withheld their fire, only letting forth
their perfect deluge of bullets when a good target appeared. This
encouraged and gave added confidence to the younger men. It was
certainly the old soldier’s day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between June and August some extremely gallant trench raids
and expeditions were carried out by the Regiment. One raid
carried out was discovered by the enemy before starting, and came
under intense fire from rifles, bombs and machine guns at close
quarters. In spite of this the party rushed forward and inflicted
heavy losses upon the enemy, but every man except one was
wounded. Two officers and some men came out into the open and
worked for two hours under fire collecting and bringing in the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>In September the Regiment moved south with the Canadian
Corps under Lieut.-General Sir Julian H. G. Byng, K.C.B.,
K.C.M.G., M.V.O., to the Somme, where until November they
took part in very severe fighting at Courcellette, Regina Trench, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion performed a very difficult feat on September 15th,
when it came up from reserve and occupied a line just after dusk
over absolutely strange ground, made unrecognizable by shell fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and in so doing was obliged to change front twice. They occupied
their position on time. Again, on September 16th, two Companies
went forward to attack an enemy trench over open ground, in full
view of the enemy, in face of deadly rifle and machine gun fire,
starting at a distance of over 800 yards and being practically wiped
out when less than 50 yards from the enemy’s trench.</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 8th, at Regina Trench, the R.C.R. and one other
Battalion were the only Canadian Battalions to capture and for the
time hold objectives. There by its gallantry and determination the
Battalion held on throughout the day outflanked and unsupported.
A Battalion of German Marines was threatening the left, which
necessitated a change of front. This was successfully accomplished.
The enemy charged the position on three separate occasions, but
were driven back with heavy loss each time. This, however, was
accomplished only by heavy loss to the Battalion, for, when
relieved, it mustered only one officer and eighty-one other ranks;
in one Company only five men remained.</p>

<p class='c007'>On leaving the Somme area the Regiment was so depleted that
it was obliged to reorganize. The fighting had been of the bitterest
hand-to-hand kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following order was published on leaving the area:</p>

<p class='c019'>“7th Canadian Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This Brigade has just finished a series of operations of which every
member may be justly proud.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The performance of the 15th September, 1916, when the R.C.R.
P.P.C.L.I., 42nd and 49th Battalions, went into an unknown area on
four and a half hours’ notice, in broad daylight, and under heavy shelling,
reached and jumped off on time, not from prepared assembly
trenches, but from a battered trench captured that morning, and, changing
direction twice, captured and held three different objectives, together
with some three hundred prisoners, has been characterized as one of the
finest accomplishments by any Brigade in the war.</p>

<p class='c019'>“No one as time goes on can fail to be more and more impressed
with the extent to which each arm of the military machine is dependent
upon others for ultimate and lasting success; a Brigade may do better
than ever before, and still fail to gain their objective, owing to another
arm not having fully accomplished its task.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The attack on September 16th, 1916, adds to, rather than dims, the
glory. Both the R.C.R. and the 42nd Battalion (R.H.C.) knew the
barrage had failed, that the Zollern Trench was fully manned, and that
the chances of success were slight. Notwithstanding, the attacking companies
of these Battalions did their duty, knowing that the attack of the
9th Canadian Infantry Brigade, timed for 6.30 p.m., depended entirely
on their capturing their objective. They thrust the attack home gallantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and well, but, under the circumstances, with the odds so heavily against
them, it was impossible to make good the Zollern Trench.</p>

<p class='c019'>“On the 8th October, 1916, Regina Trench was not battered in nor
the wire cut, but we all have good reason to be proud of the performance
of our Battalions that day—the R.C.R. and 49th Battalion for their
attack, the P.P.C.L.I. for their good work in the vacated front line, and
the 42nd Battalion (R.H.C.) for cheerfully going in again to take over
the defence of the line, although they had been withdrawn a few hours
before and were desperately tired. The Machine Gun Company also
comes in for its share of the well-earned praise for its excellent barrage
work and support of the Infantry.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We all feel particularly proud of the splendid work of the R.C.R.
in driving through to their objective and holding it so long against odds.
No one could have done better and few so well.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November the Battalion moved north again to Neuville St.
Vaast, nothing of much importance happening with the exception
of raids. These commenced after Christmas and became almost a
daily occurrence. Daring deeds of all degrees were performed by
all ranks, with the result that the Battalion was morally and actually
master of the situation and owned “No Man’s Land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On April 9, 1917, the Battle of Vimy Ridge commenced. This
was one of the most perfectly planned actions that has ever
occurred. Every man knew exactly what he had to do and how to
do it, and where he was to go. The strong ridge which the
Germans had held and fortified to the best of their ability fell into
our hands with comparative ease. Many trophies were captured
by the Regiment, and all their objectives were taken without any
delay or hitch of any kind. This was accomplished in bitter
weather and mud knee deep; the ground captured was held intact in
spite of the furious and continued attacks launched by the enemy
to wrest our gains from us.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Vimy the Regiment took part in the following major
actions:—Avion, June, 1917; Hill 70, July, 1917; Passchendaele,
October and November, 1917 (in the latter period eleven hostile
attacks were successfully repelled); Amiens, 1918, where the Regiment
was on the extreme right successfully operating with the
French; Monchy, August, 1918; Cambrai, where Lieut. M. F. Gregg
won his V.C.; Forêt de Raisines, Valenciennes; and last, but not
least, the dramatic capture of the world famous Mons. The credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>for the first to enter Mons has been claimed by the 42nd Battalion.
This is a moot point, and is probably due to the fact that a Company
of the Royal Canadian Regiment was detached to the 42nd and
entered the City from the S.E. The indubitable fact remains that
Lieut. W. M. King of the R.C.R. was the first to reach the square,
where he was received by the Mayor at the Town Hall with his
platoon, and where he signed the Golden Book of Mons, which was
given by King Albert to the City on his departure in 1914.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Regiment returned to Canada and the C.E.F. personnel was
demobilized at Halifax on 10th March, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following distinctions and awards were gained by the Regiment
in the war of 1914–18:—</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <em>THE 17th BATTALION, C.E.F.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>When war clouds lowered on the European horizon in
July, 1914, it would have been strange had the men of
Pictou County, Nova Scotia, not been among the first
to recognize their duty to civilization and the Empire.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. STRUAN G. ROBERTSON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On July 31, 1914, the officer commanding the 78th Regiment
Pictou Highlanders wired the then Minister of Militia of Canada
that his Regiment was ready for service,
and received a reply, dated August 1, 1914,
expressing the Minister’s thanks for the
patriotic offer. On August 8th orders
were received by wire from the Adjutant-General,
Ottawa, as follows: “It is notified
for information that not more than 125
men with officers will be accepted from
each rural Regiment.” This order limited
volunteering in Nova Scotian rural corps
at once to that number.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 20, 1914, 135 officers, non-commissioned
officers and other ranks left
New Glasgow for Valcartier, being joined
at Truro by a full quota of officers, non-commissioned officers
and other ranks of the 76th Colchester Rifles and small detachments
of the 63rd and 66th Halifax Regiments, a Company from
the 75th Lunenburg Regiment under Lieut.-Colonel Andrews, and
one from 69th. Passing through Cumberland County the Nova
Scotian contingent was further augmented by a roll of officers,
non-commissioned officers and men, up to the strength authorized,
from the 93rd Cumberland Regiment, with their O.C., Lieut.-Colonel
Murray, making in all a total of some five hundred officers,
non-commissioned officers and other ranks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Had each of the seven Nova Scotia Regiments of Militia been
able to send the number authorized the contingent would have been
little short of strength as a Regiment. Ottawa had apparently
overlooked the fact that both the Halifax Regiments and the 94th
of Cape Breton were on garrison duty, making it difficult for them
to recruit beyond their then imperative needs or part with the
number required.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was then proposed by the officers on board the troop train
that steps be taken to form a Nova Scotian Battalion, so that all
might serve together. The three senior officers of the contingent,
Lieut.-Colonels Andrews, Cameron and Murray asked Lieut.-Col.
S. G. Robertson to undertake the organization and ask that he be
given command. Although he had specialized as far as possible in
Staff work and felt his services would be of more value in that
line than in Regimental duty, the request was difficult of refusal
and the proposal was accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the time of arrival in Valcartier the Nova Scotians
remained together until a wire was received from the Minister
authorizing the organization of the Battalion. Unfortunately an
excessive advertising of the Unit by a too friendly press in Halifax
aroused Provincial jealousies and no doubt made fulfilment of the
authorization difficult. It undoubtedly made it appear to outsiders
that the Nova Scotian officers were doing a lot of advertising, an
opinion that was far from the truth. Time dragged on; a few
officers and men losing heart joined other Battalions; but their
number was small and all had the best reasons for doing so. In
most cases it meant promotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly before the day of sailing, the raising of two new Units
was authorized by Headquarters, to be numbered the 17th and 18th
Battalions; and the personnel of the officers was published, which
included one, if not two, of the senior Nova Scotian officers.
Recruiting, however, showed that there were no available rank and
file apart from the Nova Scotians, who, however, absolutely refused
to join without their own officers. As all prospect of a Nova
Scotian Battalion seemed to have vanished, therefore in order to
get the men to join one of the new Units, after consultation with
the men Lieut.-Colonel Robertson offered his services as Paymaster
in that Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Hardly had his services been accepted by the Officer Commanding
than the Premier arrived in Camp and called a meeting
of the Nova Scotian officers for the following morning. At the
meeting two proposals were made to the officers, who were asked
to consider them and report their decision at a later hour. The
proposals were to go then as a half Battalion or remain behind to
be properly organized and sail later. The meeting of officers
decided without dissent that to remain until properly organized was
the only course open, in view of the shortness of time and lack of
so much that was necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this report being made to the Premier he stated that it had
been decided to send us as a Battalion with the First Contingent,
to allow us to recruit as far as possible and if necessary to send
drafts later to complete our establishment. The colors of the
Battalion were then presented by Lady Borden, with appropriate
ceremony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within three days sufficient men had been recruited in Cape
Breton, Pictou, Colchester and Cumberland Counties practically to
complete the strength of a Regiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Premier was no longer in Camp, and transport was refused.
Possibly, the momentarily expected sailing of the First Contingent
made it impractical, and the Battalion sailed from Quebec on September
30, 1914, with a full strength of officers and non-commissioned
officers and 773 other ranks, unbrigaded under strength
and under-equipped, but with hearts burning with loyalty, on board
the <em>S.S. Ruthenia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just one hundred and twenty-nine years before the ancestors of
many of these men had been disbanded from the 82nd Highlanders
in Halifax and given grants of land comprising 20,000 acres in
Pictou County. The Regiment had been raised in Perthshire by
Col. Alexander Robertson of Struan, then Chief of Clan Donnachie,
and was commanded by him. Now commanded by one of the same
race and family they were returning to do their part in the world’s
tragedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nominal roll of officers was as follows: Lieut.-Col. Struan
G. Robertson; Majors, Daniel D. Cameron and Daniel Murray;
Adjutant, Capt. Charles E. Bent; Asst.-Adjutant, Lieut. L. Ray
Cutten.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Captains: W. H. Allen, L. C. Bentley, W. B. Coulter, Alex.
Watson, D. C. Sheppard, W. Forbes, Thos. Curwen Reid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenants: G. W. Harris, F. M. Bentley, F. M. McDonald,
J. E. Christie, E. W. Mingo, C. J. Groggett, J. M. Gillis, Bruce
Donald, A. N. Peerless, R. E. Russell, G. A. Ross, G. E. C. Eager,
Norman McKee, J. R. Bell, Alister Fraser, Arthur Hunt Chute,
B. J. Walker, A. Marlow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paymaster, Hon. Capt. Arthur McKay; Quartermaster, Hon.
Capt. Robert McMeekin; Medical Officer, Capt. H. Morrell;
Chaplain, Paul Goforth; Transport Officer, C. Hamilton Catty.</p>

<p class='c007'>For five months the Battalion saw service on Salisbury Plain as
a Unit. No drafts arrived to bring the Battalion up to strength,
but it was attached to one Brigade after another. Some one has
said that the ardor of the Highlander springs from internal sentiment,
and that the only thing his spirit cannot brook is disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has ever been seemingly fated that governments failed to
appreciate this characteristic of Scottish soldiers. Broken faith,
real or supposed, caused rebellion in even the Black Watch in 1743.
In 1795, when it was proposed to break up the Cameron Highlanders
by drafting, their Colonel told the Duke of York, then O. in C., “To
draft the 79th is more than you or your Royal father dare do!”
The Duke of York replied: “The King, my father, will certainly
send the Regiment to the West Indies.” Colonel Cameron thereupon
losing his temper warmly rejoined: “You may tell the King,
your father, from me, that he may send us to h—l if he likes, and
Ell go at the head of them, but he <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">daurna</span> draft us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Attempts were made to draft the men of the 17th but as they
had been enlisted over three months the Army Act made such
procedure illegal, unless voluntary, and the protest of the Officer
Commanding, after threatened proceedings, was effectual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four Battalions of the First Canadian Contingent, including the
17th, were then made into Reserve Battalions, and the non-commissioned
officers and other ranks were drafted into the First
Division to make up for the wastage suffered during its sojourn on
Salisbury Plain, which then through sickness, desertion and the
obtaining of commissions in the Imperial Forces was equivalent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>about ten per cent. of the original total strength of the First Contingent.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a Reserve Battalion the 17th served throughout the War and
practically all Nova Scotian Infantry Drafts passed at one time or
another through its ranks. From it were drawn the drafts for the
Highland Brigade 1st Division, and latterly those for Nova Scotia
Infantry Units in the Field. As a Reserve it outlived many of its
enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the gallant hearts that left Nova Scotia in August, 1914,
many have paid the price and sleep their last sleep on alien soil.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <em>THE 25th BATTALION.</em></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY CAPT. G. C. M‘ELHENNY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In endeavoring to write this brief account of the organization,
training and operations of the first Battalion of Nova Scotians
to be raised and equipped in their own Province and also the
first from these “the sea-girt hills and vales,” which have contributed
more than their quota of soldiers, sailors, statesmen,
educators and men of affairs in the past, to man the trenches in
France and Flanders, the writer regrets and wishes it understood
that he is not writing from personal observations, inasmuch as (and
this is what he regrets) he was not a member of the 25th Battalion
until the spring of 1917. The substance, then, of the following is
compiled from the War Diary of the 25th Canadian Infantry
Battalion, and is submitted to the publishers of this volume at their
request and with the fullest appreciation of the writer’s inability to
do justice to the task of chronicling four and a half years of any
Battalion’s history, least of all the splendid story of the indomitable
courage and tenacious striving toward an ideal which were the
predominant features of this, in several respects, an unique Battalion
in the Canadian Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many omissions in the following narrative which the
writer regrets are imperative in order to make it of sufficient
brevity to allow of its publication in this volume. The nominal
roll of officers is as issued by the Department of Militia and
Defence on the Battalion’s sailing from Halifax on May 20, 1915.
The summary of decorations awarded was provided by the
Adjutant-General, Canadian Militia, Ottawa, and does not include
the medals won by General Hilliam, C.B., and several other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>officers and some other ranks when with Units other than the 25th
Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be interesting to note in the list of original 2nd Division
officers who marched across the Rhine at Bonn on December 13,
1918, that only two were commissioned officers on September 15,
1915. They are Major A. W. P. Weston and Lieut. G. M.
McNeil, M.C. There were ninety-six other ranks with the Battalion
on both the above-mentioned dates.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the narrative there are many points on which the writer
would like to dilate at some length—more especially on some of
the deeds of heroism in the different actions. Of these deeds,
practically in the earlier days (1915 and 1916), more went unrecognized
outside the Battalion than the sum of all the decorations
won by the Battalion. To mention more than the few that fit into
the narrative is obviously not feasible.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing that cheered the 25th Battalion through all their long
service in France was the pipe band under Pipe-Major Carson.
Major J. W. Logan was responsible for the organization and equipment
of this fine band. There was nothing better in the armies in
France.</p>

<p class='c007'>In pursuance of the Canadian Government’s scheme to raise
a Second Division for service Overseas, Lieut.-Col. G. A. Lecain
(69th Regiment), of Roundhill, Annapolis County, was authorized
to mobilize the 25th Battalion, Canadian Infantry, in Nova Scotia
(October, 1914). Lieut.-Colonel Lecain established headquarters
at the Armories, Halifax, and opened recruiting offices in Sydney,
Amherst, New Glasgow, Truro and Yarmouth. Recruiting commenced
late in October, 1914. The official nominal roll of officers
who received appointments to the Battalion is published here and to
them is due the credit of the splendid organization and training
which enabled these sons of New Scotland to rank second to none
with the flower of the British Armies. Mention should also be
made of the fine non-commissioned officers of the Battalion and
those loaned by the Permanent Force, who attended to the details
of training with most commendable zeal.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. G. A. LECAIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It should be remembered that this was Nova Scotia’s first
attempt at recruiting and organizing a full Battalion for service in
the Great War, and the facilities for the proper fulfilment of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a task were far from perfect. In view of this then Nova Scotians
should be, and, I think, are, unanimous in their praise of Lieut.-Colonel
Lecain and all ranks of his Battalion for his organizing
and so quickly training a Unit which, though many times decimated
and only a skeleton of a Battalion left, quickly and smoothly
absorbed its reinforcements and carried on with renewed energy
and greater deeds toward the high ideal
of service for home and humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer has often had it suggested
to him that it was a pity the deeds of the
25th Battalion were not better known by
the people at home. The reply to such a
suggestion, on behalf of the Battalion is
this: The reputation of the 25th Battalion
was safe in the hands of our comrades
throughout the Canadian Corps,
and our exploits in raiding were the
marvel of two armies. These exploits
and deeds with their inevitable accompaniment
of blood and death were not fit subjects to press-agent
into the already overwrought family circles, which were possibly
in receipt of one of those missiles of despair and death—an “official
telegram from Ottawa.” We gloried in the encomiums of the
Brigade, Divisional, Corps and Army Commanders, and still more
in the hearty praise of our comrades in the “Y” or the canteens
or estaminets. But no one thought of sending an account home.
And why? Well, there were a good many Bills, and Jocks, and
Toms and so on, who “went west” in that scrap. And what’s the
use of making it realistic to Mary and Nora and Bessie? “No,
Pard, we would rather not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And there we will leave it and endeavor to adhere to a resolution
to make this brief sketch statistically correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Christmas Day, 1914, the Battalion was at full strength
and had the authorized ten per cent. reserve in training in the
Armories at Halifax and later on the Common. In April the
people of Nova Scotia presented the Battalion with two fine field
kitchens and $2,500, the ceremony taking place at the Provincial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Building, in front of the whole Battalion on parade and a vast
concourse of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>As evidence of the fine spirit which animated the whole Battalion
the-following is copied from the official War Diary: “A
University Reinforcement Company of the P.P.C.L.I. arrived in
the city to embark for England, and the 25th Battalion was called
on to supply seven men to bring it up to strength. The Battalion
was formed up on the Common and an invitation extended for any
who wished to go Overseas at once in this draft to take one pace
forward. The whole Battalion, to a man, stepped forward making
it necessary to search the records and select seven ex-imperial
service men. Privates Aldridge, Baker, Conroy, Cumberland,
Erickson, Kehoe and Leonard were selected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On sailing for England aboard <em>H.M.T.S. Saxonia</em> (Captain
Charles, R.N.) on May 20, 1915, Haligonians and many from other
points in the Province witnessed many a moving spectacle as bright
countenances fought the dimming influence of heavy hearts as they
wished the boys of the 25th Godspeed on their journey, and victory
in the fight; leaving their safe return or immortalization in the
hands of the Creator who deals justly and well in all things. With
the 25th Battalion on board the <em>Saxonia</em> were those gallant sons of
Quebec, the 22nd Battalion. No account of the doings of the 25th
Battalion could do justice to its purpose without paying tribute to
those noble French-Canadians who were continually associated with
the 25th Battalion from embarkation at Halifax on May 20, 1915,
to debarkation at the same port on May 16, 1919. Surely there is
a lesson for our politicians and religious bigots in the close co-operation
which marked the attitude of these two Battalions toward
each other throughout the period of their association. Our brave
comrades of the 22nd Battalion showed us that the French-Canadian
was not only generous in sympathy but quick to
collaborate with his fellow Canadians of British descent on the
broad principle of national welfare. In battle, in sports, or in
argument over the estaminet tables, proof of the whole-hearted
camaraderie between the 22nd and 25th Battalions was daily
evident and fostered by both Units.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Saxonia</em> docked at Devonport on May 29, 1915, and her
valuable human cargo took trains for Westenhanger, in Kent County,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>where they detrained in the middle of the night and marched to
East Sandling Camp, in the Shorncliffe area, to which the 2nd
Canadian Division had been assigned for the period of their intensive
training.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this training was being carried out the Battalion took part
in Divisional Reviews by H.M. the King, Earl Kitchener, Lieut-General
Sir Sam Hughes and General Steele, as well as one in
honor of the visit to the area by the Premier of Canada, Sir Robert
Borden, and Brigade and Training Inspectors. The 25th Battalion
was now a Unit of the 5th (Eastern Canada) Brigade, 2nd
Canadian Division, which consisted of four Battalions and details
(22nd, 24th, 25th and 26th) drawn from Quebec, Montreal, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick. The Brigade Commander was Lieut.-Colonel
(now Major-General) Sir David Watson, and Major-General
R. W. Turner, V.C., was Divisional Commander.</p>

<p class='c007'>After three and a half months of eight hours’ training per day,
with four hours of practice in night operations’ frequently, the
2nd Division was ordered to France. The 25th Battalion proceeded
by boat from Folkestone to Boulogne on the night of September
15, 1915, and by train on the following day from Pont de Brieques,
a few kilometres from Boulogne, to a small station near St. Omer.
From here to the front line was the first real test of the Battalion’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> and physical condition. Marching for five days with
new (Kitchener’s) boots over French and Belgian cobblestone
roads, the Battalion relieved the King’s Own Regiment on the
night of the 22nd–23rd of September, 1915, the first Nova Scotia
Battalion to face the Hun as a Unit. And not a man had dropped
out in the gruelling grind of the last four days. The writer has
been told, unofficially, that this was a record for the Division, and
though it has never been confirmed, neither has it been denied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first few tours in the front lines were spent in the H and I
trenches, Kemmel Sector of the Ypres Salient, where the Hun was
very active in mining operations. During the Battalion’s second
tour, which extended over six days, Fritz blew one large and three
smaller mines on “B” Company, which killed twelve and wounded
twenty, leaving a crater 65 feet by 35 feet and 25 feet deep. This
resulted in no advantage to the enemy, inasmuch as the charge was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>situated so that it must have done considerable damage to his
trenches, and the crater was promptly garrisoned by Nova Scotians.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_075.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>BRIG.-GEN. E. HILLIAM, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Late in October, 1915, Major E. Hilliam, a 1st Division officer,
succeeded Lieut.-Colonel Lecain in command of the Battalion; and,
under his soldierly guidance, the 25th began to make the Bosche
sit up and notice his surroundings. Under Major (as O.C., Lieut.-Colonel)
Hilliam’s guidance the Battalion
became expert in the little tricks which
worried the enemy and made trench life
more interesting. Notable among the
many episodes which added spice to the
daily routine was a raid on the Hun
trenches by Lieutenant (now Lieut.-Colonel)
Wise, and the stalking of a German
patrol in No Man’s Land by Corporal
(now Captain) “Ernie” Canning, which
resulted in the capture of one of their
number and the gaining of much information.
The small garrison of thirty-five
25th Battalion men, under Lieutenants
Morgan, Johnstone and McNeil, holding Nos. 1 and 4 craters at
St. Eloi in April, 1915, gave the attacking company of Huns a
sample of the unbeatable stuff they are made of.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April the 25th Battalion took over the line at St. Eloi where
they remained about six weeks. This was beyond a doubt the most
trying experience which the Battalion had to that time or has since
been called upon to endure. There were no front line trenches.
Five mine craters had to be occupied, since the front line trenches
were all destroyed, and the men had to occupy most exposed positions.
Every hole and every remnant remaining of a trench were
used as the only possible cover, and mud, muck and water prevailed.
Under continually heavy and harrowing fire and attacks the
Battalion endured, though at the price of the loss of hundreds of its
personnel. The German artillery fire in the Ypres Salient was the
heaviest of the War. With enemy artillery on three sides, the
situation may better be imagined than described. One crater that
was occupied by the Battalion was attacked no less than five times
between dusk and dawn in one night alone, but the crater was held.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>When the garrison was relieved there were not enough men left to
bring out the wounded and a relief party had to be sent in for that
purpose. On this front all intercommunication was impossible and
isolated parties held the lines. The Battalion was highly commended
by the higher command for their excellent work on this front.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion spent 339 days on the Belgian Front, of which 164
days were spent in actual front line trenches. Many good officers
and men were killed or wounded. Among the former was
Lieutenant Douglas, who was killed while fighting with the 6th
(Western) Brigade in the craters of St. Eloi. Lieutenant Douglas
was Battalion Machine Gun Officer and had been loaned with the
machine gun section to the 6th Brigade during the furious onslaughts
which the Hun was making on the craters. The men with
Lieutenant Douglas were all killed excepting five who were captured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the Kemmel and St. Eloi Sectors, the 25th Battalion
were engaged at Vierstraat, Ploegsteerte, Hill 60, Hooge and Messines.
And it was here, also, that the Battalion obtained “Robert
the Bruce,” mascot and veteran of three years’ service in the land of
his birth. It would be hard for one to see the immense, sleek goat
now on the farm of Major Matheson at Baddeck and endeavor to
imagine the same animal, two weeks old, hardly bigger than a cat,
feeding from a bottle in the hands of Pipe-Major Carson in the
kitchen of the band’s billet in Locre. But they are one and the
same animal. The members of the band bought him from the
“Madame” of the house for two francs (40c.), and trained him to
“swank” in front of the pipe band, eat cigarettes, drink beer, and
demand his blanket at “lights out.” He added many other traits
and tricks to his repertoire before the Battalion was disbanded, and
many a would-be possessor of our mascot has felt the force of his
“butt” sufficiently to make them all leave “Robert the Bruce”
strictly to his own Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 25th Battalion played a leading part in the assault at
Courcellette on September 15, 1916. The whole Corps welcomed
the relief from the ground-hog tactics of the fray in Belgium and
looked forward with keen anticipation to their participation in open
warfare tactics on the Somme in Picardy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops marched a good portion of the long distance from
Hazebrouck to Albert. The 25th Battalion spent a few days on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>way in rehearsing practices in formations for advancing and assaulting
and arrived in the brickfields of Albert where the whole Division
and units of the 1st and 3rd Divisions were massed under tarpaulins
and corrugated iron, a few days in advance of September 15, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of attack on the immediate front of Courcellette was
for the 4th (Ontario) Brigade to open the attack on the morning
of the fifteenth (15th) and clear the ground in front of Courcellette
and on the sixteenth (16th) the 5th Brigade would carry on the
attack into the town. The 4th Brigade had their objectives cleared
and consolidated so early in the day that the Divisional Commander
decided to put the 5th Brigade over the top at 6 o’clock in the afternoon.
Brig.-General MacDonnell (5th Brigade) divided the town
evenly, pointed out the objectives to Lieut.-Colonel Tremblay
(22nd Battalion) and Lieut.-Colonel Hilliam, explained that the
other two Battalions would be in support and reserve and sent the
Quebecers and Nova Scotians to it. Both Battalions were led in
person by their commanding officers, who set a fine example of
leadership and courage to officers and men. The 25th and 22nd
Battalions established their line well to the east of the ruined town
and maintained their positions in the face of fierce counter-attacks
until relieved a few days later.</p>

<p class='c007'>This operation, brilliant as it was in execution, cost the Battalion
some of its most capable officers and men. Lieut.-Colonel Hilliam
was wounded in the hand, but refused to leave the line until his
Battalion was relieved. He was in evidence everywhere throughout
the attack with his long stick cheering his men and by his energy
and daring urging them to their best endeavors. In his report to
the G.O.C., 5th Brigade, he praised the work of officers and men
very highly, and closed with the words, “General, I have the honor
of commanding the finest body of men I have ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three Company Commanders, Major Tupper (“A” Company),
Major Brooks (“D” Company), and Capt. John Stairs (“C”
Company), were killed, and the O.C. “B” Company, Major Flowers,
was severely wounded. The Adjutant, Captain Dicky, Lieutenants
Hobkirk, Howson, Craig and Doane were killed. The wounded
included Capt. J. D. McNeil, Major Nutter, Lieutenants Wetmore,
Ryan, DeYoung and Dennis Stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Before I pass from the doings of the Battalion on the Somme,
it is necessary, in order to do justice to the narrative, to record the
loss of one of the bravest and most capable officers of the Battalion
and one who gave great promise as a fearless and resourceful
fighter for high ideals. I refer to Lieut. L. H. Johnstone, who led
the 25th Battalion in the fruitless and bloody attack on Regina
Trench, October 1st, 1916. While gallantly leading those men into
a veritable hell of machine gun and shell fire, the “Iron Duke,” as
he was nicknamed by the gallant men he was leading, fell to rise no
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Battalion finally moved from the Somme area to be
reinforced and recuperated there were less than one hundred of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>original crusaders who marched so gaily from Flanders less than one
month previously. Though they had received a hard drubbing they
made the old nickname of “Herring-choker” one to be respected
as long as memory lives and histories are written. Theirs was not
the attitude of the torn and mangled dog with its tail between its
legs. With reinforcements, which arrived while the remnants of
the Battalion rested a few days at Bertrincourt, near Albert, they
were transported to Hersin, and immediately went into the line at
Bully-Grenay, on the Lens Front, where, with a pugnacity which is
typical of the breed, they stirred up a quiet sector until it became
the most frequently raided and most heavily shelled of their
experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first raid on this front, and one of the most successful, was
the enterprise, on Christmas Eve, 1916, directed by Capt. W. A.
Cameron and carried out by an officer and twenty men from each
Company. The objective took in a point in the enemy lines known
as the “Pope’s Nose,” owing to the peculiar twist in the trench
which brought it to within fifteen yards of our line. Each party
was successful in gaining entrance to the Hun trenches. In fact,
two of the parties encountered no opposition, for Fritz had fled for
cover. But the party from “D” Company, under Lieut. (now
Capt.) W. A. Livingstone, found their objective strongly manned
and the men were able to get in some splendid bayonet and Mills
bomb work. They saved seven specimens of German Kultur to tell
our Intelligence Staff what they knew about the situation on the
other side of No Man’s Land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Cameron, Lieutenants Livingstone and Morris received
Military Crosses in recognition of their energy and personal gallantry
in the above affair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Colonel Hilliam, D.S.O., was promoted to the rank of
Brigadier-General and appointed to the command of the 10th
Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Division, in January, 1917. The
Battalion at having their C.O. selected for a higher command recognized
that no promotion in the Allied Forces was more deserved;
but regret at the Battalion’s loss was expressed by all ranks. The
effects of his soldierly training and administration of the Battalion
remained with them throughout the War.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>In the attack on Vimy Ridge, Easter Monday, April 9, 1917,
the 25th Battalion was led by Major J. A. Delancey, M.C., until
that brave officer was killed, after which Major (now Colonel)
A. O. Blois, of Halifax (who had enlisted as a private in the 40th
Battalion, been appointed to a commission in the 64th Battalion,
transferred a subaltern to the 25th Battalion and had progressed
at that date through the Adjutancy of the Battalion to the rank of
Major), took command, and organized and consolidated the objectives
which had all been secured by ten o’clock and were extended
later in the day.</p>

artillery drowned the skirling notes of the pibroch, our lads were
fired with the spirit which prompted these two noble musicians
to volunteer and insist on accompanying the Battalion through the
muck and mire, the death and destruction which was let loose on that
fateful day. They were awarded Military Medals for their splendid
example of self-sacrificing disregard for personal safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Hallisey, of Truro, was killed while proceeding to
the “jumping off” position. Several officers were wounded, and
the casualties among the N.C.O.’s and men were very heavy. The
death of R.S.M. “Dad” Henchcliffe, M.C., father of all the N.C.O.’s
and men in the Battalion, was particularly regrettable; for he was a
very efficient warrant officer and a friend to all.</p>

<p>LIEUT.-COL. “STAN” BAULD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Colonel Bauld commanded the Battalion at the taking of
Fresnoy and Arleux late in February. While these were only local
affairs and confined to a narrow front, they were the cause of some
very severe casualties. “D” and “C” Companies suffered very
severely at Arleux. Captain Weare, M.C., was severely shell-shocked,
Lieutenants Bell and Wallace, two very promising young
officers, were killed, and scores of our
men caught in the wire, in the darkness,
were literally shot to pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after this affair, two officers’
batmen from “C” Company went astray
in the darkness with their officers’ rations
and strayed into the enemy lines. Their
whereabouts was a matter of conjecture
until the publication of the roll of prisoners
of war. In the thirty-eight months
during which the 25th Battalion was in
contact with the flower of the German
War Lord’s Legions, only eight of our
men were captured alive. The five machine-gunners have
already been noted. They were detached from the Battalion at
the time of their capture. The two mentioned above were the
victims of a dark night and unfamiliar recently captured ground.
The eighth man to be captured was taken on the Mericourt Sector
early in 1918 during a raid by a party of three officers and ninety
Huns on a thinly held portion of the sector. We also succeeded in
capturing one of the raiding party who was unfortunate enough to
get into our wire entanglements. A great deal of information was
gleaned from the captive regarding the training and composition of
the raiding party. The man who was captured by the enemy had
only joined the Battalion a few days previously. So what information
the German Intelligence Staff gleaned from him must have been
purely family affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in July, 1917, Lieut.-Colonel Bauld obtained leave of
absence to visit his home, and the command of the Battalion
devolved on Major Blois, D.S.O., who commanded the 25th, until
he in turn was granted leave to Canada in May, 1918.</p>

<p>COL. A. G. BLOIS, D.S.O.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The 25th Battalion played a glorious part in the Battle of Hill
70 on August 15, 1917. The boys went over the top from the shell-holes
of No Man’s Land in front of Cité St. Laurent. “A” Company,
in the first wave, secured the Hun front line. “B” Company
was through them as soon as the creeping barrage permitted
and clinched the support line, while “D” Company carried on to the
limits of the town. The 24th Battalion
then pushed on our positions 600 yards
farther to the trench “Nun’s Alley.”
Considering the amount of ground gained
and the nature of the fighting, in ruined
streets and over demolished buildings, the
casualties were very light on the 15th.
But the Hun artillery promptly laid down
a barrage to cover his counter-attacks,
which fell behind the front line and completely
churned up the debris formerly
known as Cité St. Laurent, where the 25th
Battalion was endeavoring to establish
a defensive position. The counter-attacks of the Bosche gradually
weakened, and by the 18th had ceased; but his artillery strafing
grew more intense as the days passed, causing many casualties.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the night of August 19–20, the 25th Battalion moved from
their positions in Cité St. Laurent to the comparative peace and
quiet of the front line. At daybreak the 6th Brigade on our
immediate right were to attack and tighten the pressure already
exercised on Lens. The Hun also divulged his reason for the
systematic and furious shelling of our positions during the past six
days when he launched an attack in force on the 6th Brigade and
extending into our right (“D” Company’s front). The O.C. “D”
Company, being in an advanced position and close to our own
artillery barrage line, was ordered to place his men under cover,
which he did, leaving only sentries at the entrances to shelters.</p>

<p>CAPT. OWEN C. DAUPHINEE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Zero hour for the 6th Brigade’s and the German attack coincided
and both were demoralized by the intensity of the artillery fire they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>encountered before the assembly positions could be cleared. The
result was that neither the 6th Brigade nor the Prussians opposite
them left their trenches. But the artillery was not so active on the
Front of our “D” Company, with the result that the Huns were
throwing grenades down on our dugout steps before our men
realized that they were trapped. Lieutenant Dauphinee was killed
in a gallant attempt to clear the entrance
to the dugout in which the whole Company
was sheltered. Captain W. A. Livingstone,
M.C., O.C. “D” Company,
managed to force his way out by another
entrance, and with a Lewis Gun spitting
.303 bullets from his shoulder, he managed
to clear the trench of those who
escaped his fusilade. But the trench was
literally filled with corpses from the
attacking hordes. Nor was the situation
normal as yet. A party of Huns had got
in on the right of our boundary, and
Lieutenant Spurr and Sergeant Jordan,
after expelling them, organized the survivors of the Company of a
Western Battalion, who had lost all their officers and were in a
precarious condition. The boys of “D” Company, reinforced by a
platoon from “B” Company, which had been led up through the
intense shelling by Lieutenant Bell, were busy all day repelling
bombing parties which stubbornly attempted to force their way into
our lines at the Battalion boundary-the junction of Nun’s Alley
and Commotion Trenches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Livingstone, whose work on this day merited the
Victoria Cross, was severely wounded in the chest and collapsed
immediately after he had cleared the Huns from his trenches, and
Lieutenant Spurr commanded his company until relieved by a
company of the Royal Canadian Regiment at night. Great credit
is due Lieutenants Gibbons and Bell for their skill and judgment
in rallying our boys and organizing the defences. The coolness of
Sergeant Jordan saved the situation on the immediate right, when he
rallied the overwrought survivors of the Western Battalion. Corporal
Boudreau, Company Sergt.-Major Bragg, Corporal Veniot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and Sergt. “Dan” Fraser also distinguished themselves in inflicting
punishment on the Hun and by their heroic conduct throughout the
day. Company Sergt.-Major Bragg and Sergeant Jordan were
awarded Distinguished Conduct Medals for their services on this
occasion. Captain Livingstone, M.C., was awarded a bar, and
Lieutenant Spurr, the Military Cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Passchendaele, on November 10, 1917, the 5th Infantry
Brigade was given the post of honor as a successful assaulting
Brigade. The 1st, 3rd and 4th Divisions and the 4th Brigade of
the 2nd Division had been engaged in nibbling here and there at the
Hun positions and had at length captured most of the Passchendaele
Ridge. But the ruined town still remained in German hands. On
the morning of the 6th November the 26th Battalion attacked and
captured the ruins to the eastern limits of the town and after holding
their gains for four days the 5th Brigade was withdrawn from
the Passchendaele Sector, and returned to Lens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 2nd Canadian Division remained in the Lens-Mericourt
Sectors until the latter part of February, 1918. The only notable
occurrence, other than the loss of one man to the Huns, as previously
noted, was the stealth raid led by Lieut. P. R. Phillips, of
Barrington, assisted by a covering party under Lieut. Max
MacRae, of Westville. The raiding party of only five crawled
over the Lens-Arras Road and made their way among the battered
houses of Lens to one of the buildings of Fosse 3 and destroyed
a dugout full of “Heinies,” bringing the sentry who was on duty
at the entrance into our lines. The prisoner proved to be a very
observant chap and a great deal of information was gleaned from
him. When questioned as to the great offensive which our Staff
expected daily, he said no attack would be made on the Canadians.
Fritz had probably had his fill of attacking Canucks when he broke
his head on them in the First Battle of Ypres, at St. Eloi and the
Barrier.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 2nd Division had completed ten days.of what was to be a
months’ rest when the long-expected Hun offensive broke away
south on the British right on March 21st. The 25th Battalion had
only started their syllabus of training and recreation when they
were ordered south. The northern limits of this effort of the Hun
was marked by the southern boundary of the Canadian Corps’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>front, and here the 2nd Division took over the completely disorganized
line of the Imperial troops. The sector was known as the
Mercatel-Neuville Vetasse Sector. Here the 25th Battalion was
engaged three months in punishing the German Division opposite.
Each period of six days spent in the front line was marked by a
raid on the enemy outposts, and sometimes our boys penetrated
three-quarters of a mile into the Hun lines. So completely terrorized
was Fritz by the vigorous onslaughts which occurred almost
nightly and several times in broad daylight that no resistance was
offered in most cases, and at length the news was gleaned from
some of the last prisoners that the whole Division had to be withdrawn
for re-equipment.</p>

<p>LIEUT.-COL. J. WISE, D.S.O., M.C., CROIX DE GUERRE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The 25th Battalion established themselves as the “Master
Raiders” of the Canadian Corps, and were called on for some
officers and non-commissioned officers to instruct the famous
Guards Division in the new and most effective art of keeping Fritz
worried. Six of the raids conducted on this front were led by
one officer, Lieut. (now Major) Max MacRae, every one of which
netted prisoners, besides machine guns and documents. Among
the other officers taking part in these raids
were Captains Anderson and Holmes,
Lieutenants Lounsbury, Hawes, Bell,
Johnstone, Holly, Burchell, Spurr, and
Wright. It was here that the Battalion
established its record of successful raids
and became known throughout the 1st
and the 4th Armies as the “Raiding
Battalion,” putting on about thirty raids
in this sector.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Colonel (now Colonel) Blois,
D.S.O., was granted leave to Canada and
handed the Battalion over to Major (now
Lieut.-Colonel) Wise in May, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the battle of Amiens, August 8, 1918, when the Canadian
Corps was first launched into the grand offensive which broke the
German morale and brought them begging for peace, the 25th
Battalion was on the left of the Canadian Corps and in touch with
the dashing Australian Corps on their left. The attack, like that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of nearly two years previous at Courcellette, was made with the 4th
Brigade taking Villers, Brettonneux, and Marcelcave on the
Amiens-Roye Railway, and a considerable stretch of country to the
right of those towns. The plans were so well guarded and the
assemblage of troops, guns, etc., so effectively concealed, that the
enemy was utterly stunned at the suddenness of the attack and the
speed with which it was pushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the 4th Brigade had established their line in front of
Marcelcave the 5th Brigade carried on the attack through Wiencourt
and Guillaucourt. The 25th Battalion encountered considerable
opposition in a small wood south of Wiencourt; and it was
there that most of the casualties occurred. Lieut. J. W. Holly, of
St. John, was killed by machine-gun fire, and thirteen other officers
were wounded in ousting the Huns from this wood.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>CAPT. N. H. WETMORE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At Guillaucourt, Lieut.-Colonel Wise, who was the first to
arrive at the objective, fell, severely wounded by a sniper’s bullet.
The Adjutant, Capt. N. H. Wetmore, utterly disregarding his own
safety, sprang to his O.C.’s assistance and became the target for a
better directed bullet from the same sniper
and fell, never to rise again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Day, second in command, who
had been acting as a Brigade liaison officer
during the attack, immediately assumed
command of the Battalion and directed it
in the advance on the following day when
the towns of Vrely and Meharicourt were
taken. After having advanced twelve
miles in two days, the 2nd Division gave
place to the 4th, who carried on to the
outskirts of Hallu. This attack was certainly
the most successful in which the
25th Battalion had thus far been engaged. An immense area of
beautiful country with some important towns had been taken from
the Hun, with surprisingly few casualties.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few days in the line in front of Hallu, the Battalion was
moved to Berneville, near Arras, where the details were left behind
and we were into it again—over Telegraph Hill and down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>eastern slope to the Cojuel River on August 26th—a distance
of four miles—fighting all the way; then across the dried-up bed
of the stream on the 27th to Cherisy and past the Sensee River to
the heights beyond; and then a tightening up of the Hun resistance,
which meant a fruitless hammering at the strongly wired
positions in front of Upton Wood and “the Crow’s Nest” on the
28th.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 2nd Division had not rested since the 5th of August, and
had penetrated to great depths in the enemy’s lines on two fronts.
The tired troops could accomplish no more. The writer can
testify that men actually fell asleep on their feet on the night of
the 28th–29th of August, when a counter-attack was imminent.
The state of mind of men when so thoroughly exhausted as our
boys were at the end of the third day, is one that cares not what
may happen to a body so completely worn out. It is then that
sentiment—love of home, Battalion pride, and the shame of weakness—asserts
itself and supports a man when everything tangible is
wobbling.</p>

<p>CAPT. M. L. TUPPER.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“C” Company lost a splendid officer
when Capt. M. L. Tupper was killed. A
relative of Major J. H. Tupper, who
“paid the price” at Courcellette in 1916,
he had shown a fearlessness in the face of
the enemy and a conscientiousness in all
his duties which well merited his appointment
as O.C. “C” Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion had a respite of two
days at Hautes Avesnes, on the Arras-St.
Pol Road, over the anniversary of the
landing in France and the Battle of Courcellette,
September 15th, and was then
continuously in the forward area until after the fall of Cambrai on
October 9, 1918, engaging the Hun in the Inchy-Moeuvres and the
Marcomg Switch Sectors, and clearing the Hun from the towns of
Eseadoeueres and Ievuy, on the northern outskirts of Cambrai.
“B” Company, under Lieutenant (now Major) MacRae, M.C.
(two bars), did splendid work at Inchy on the 21st and 22nd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>September, when they captured seven machine guns, killing the
crews and straightening out a kink in our line.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this wonderful last hundred days of the War, when the Hun
had to be dislodged from the positions he had been preparing
since his first check at the Marne in 1914, the deeds of valor which
were enacted daily and hourly were too numerous to refer to here
at any length. But mention may be made of some of the more
notable recipients of War Decorations awarded officers, N.C.O.’s
and men, who served with the 25th Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>First in the list must come Lieut.-Colonel (now Brig.-General)
Hilliam, who won the D.S.O. and two bars for personal gallantry
in the field and was mentioned in despatches four times. He was
also invested with the insignia of a Companion of the Bath (C.B.)
and that of a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George (C.M.G.). Another officer who carries two rows of medals
on his breast is Major G. McL. Matheson, D.S.O., M.C., and M.M.
Lieut.-Colonel Wise wears the D.S.O. and the M.C., with the French
Croix de Guerre. Lieut. M. M. Jordan wears the M.C., D.C.M.
and Bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Max MacRae was awarded the Military Cross three times.
Company Sergt.-Major Dauphinee and Corporal Leggett each were
awarded the Military Medal three times. Regimental Sergt.-Major
Hurley was awarded the Military Cross, D.C.M. and French Croix
de Guerre. Company Sergt.-Major Boudreau received the Croix
de Virtute (Roumanian) besides the D.C.M., M.M. and Bar.
Private Mickarek won the Russian Cross of St. George. And many
officers and men won Military Crosses, D.C.M.’s, M.M.’s and Bars.
A summary of the Battalion’s record of awards is given further
below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last occasion on which the 25th Battalion was in hostile
contact with the Hun was at the storming of Elouges, a mining
town near Mons, on November 8, 1918. The casualties, though
very light, only eleven men being killed, included some of the
originals who had seen the thing through to this ringing down of
the curtain. Some eleven, including Company Sergt.-Major George
Vincent, D.C.M., Corpl. John Morrison and “Billie” Roberts, who
had weathered the storm only to be swept over at the harbor’s
mouth, lie asleep in the little civilian cemetery at Elouges, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>their graves will be guarded and cared for by the grateful people
of the town, who welcomed the Battalion as liberators.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boys of the Battalion were enjoying their “lionization” by
the populace at Mons when the news was received at 9 a.m. on
November 11, 1918, that we had but two hours more of hostilities
when the Armistice would become effective.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remaining three days were given over to celebrating what
had been fought for, and prayed for during the last four years—<em>Victory</em>.
A Thanksgiving Service was held in the little chapel in
the town, conducted by the brave chaplain who had stuck to us
through the “Last Hundred Days”—Capt. A. J. MacDonald. And
the local pastor addressed us in an impassioned Address of Thanks
in French, out of which the writer distinguished only the oft-repeated
phrase, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci beaucoup, nos liberateurs</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 19, 1918, the Battalion started on the long march
to the Rhine. We crossed the German border near St. Vith at
10.08 a.m., December 5th, with the Union Jack flying at the head of
the column. At 10.47 a.m., December 13th, the Battalion crossed
the Rhine at Bonn and proceeded to the “Cologne Bridgehead
Outpost Line,” where we had the satisfaction of telling the Hun
how he should act and also the pleasure of enforcing our instructions
on him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After six weeks on the Rhine, during which all ranks had an
opportunity of visiting the famous cities of Cologne, Bonn and
Coblenz, the Battalion returned to Belgium and went into billets at
Arvelais, near Namur. On April 5, 1919, we started for Havre, and
on the night of the 9th embarked on the old <em>Prince Arthur</em>, formerly
of the Boston-Yarmouth service, and on the morning of the 10th
arrived at Southampton and proceeded by train to Witley Camp in
Surrey, where, after a month’s sojourn awaiting documents from
the Record Office, we sailed from Southampton on the <em>Olympic</em>,
May 10, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>On board were the whole 5th Brigade and the 29th Battalion,
6th Brigade. After an uneventful though pleasant voyage, and to
the accompaniment of the music of several bands and the shrill
whistles of factories, boats and auto horns on both sides of Halifax
Harbor, the <em>Olympic</em> docked at Pier 2; and after a farewell to the
22nd, 24th, 26th and 29th we lined up for our march to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Armories, which triumphal procession, to the writer, seemed to be
but a part of a great dream, as the memory of the exile from home
now seems but an hallucination.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <em>THE 40th BATTALION.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 40th Battalion was authorized January 1, 1915, under the
command of Lieut.-Col. W. H. Gibsone (R.C.R.). As the
men were recruited, detachments were formed at McNab’s
Island, Halifax, Sydney, Glace Bay, North Sydney, Truro, Amherst,
New Glasgow, Yarmouth, Lunenburg, Kentville and Digby.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was finally mobilized at Aldershot Camp, N.S.,
on May 11, 1915. Lieut.-Colonel Gibsone proceeded direct to
France to become A.A.G. of the 3rd Canadian Division, which was
then in process of formation. At Aldershot Camp, N.S., the 40th
was first inspected by the Duke of Connaught and Brig.-General
H. M. McLean, who commented on their splendid showing. On
June 21st, under the command of Lieut.-Col. A. G. Vincent, the
40th Battalion moved to Valcartier Camp, Quebec. Before leaving
for Valcartier two drafts were despatched, one of twenty-five men
to the 25th Battalion, and another of 250 men and five officers to
England, as reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Valcartier strenuous work by all ranks drew special mention
of the 40th by Major-General Sir Sam Hughes at a General Review
of the Camp a week before sailing. The Battalion was also inspected
later at Valcartier by the Duke of Connaught and also by Sir
Robert Borden. A week before sailing a third call was made for
reinforcements, and again five officers and 250 N.C.O.’s and men,
all picked, were despatched to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this great drain, on October 18, 1915, the 40th
sailed from Quebec on the <em>S.S. Saxonia</em>, with a strength of 1,143
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>all ranks, under the command of Lieut.-Col. A. G. Vincent and the

<p class='c007'>On October 29, 1915, after an uneventful voyage the Battalion
landed at Plymouth and proceeded to Bramshott Camp, being the
first Canadian Infantry Battalion to enter that Camp, where they
took over quarters from the Royal Irish Rifles. At Bramshott the
40th joined part of the then contemplated 9th Brigade of the 3rd
Canadian Division, which was under the command of General Lord
Brooke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the heavy demand for reinforcements, following the
disastrous action of June 2, 1916 (the Third Battle of Ypres),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the Battalion was moved to East Sandling to become the 40th
Reserve Battalion, where drafts were despatched to nearly every
Unit in the Canadian Corps. After many moves the 40th absorbed
the remnants of the 64th, 104th, 106th and 112th Battalions, and
finally returned to Bramshott to become the 26th Reserve Battalion,
and was finally absorbed by the 17th Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition, nineteen were, wounded.

Several were promoted and mentioned in
despatches for valuable service. It would
be a long list to give the names of the N.C.O.’s and men of the
original 40th who gave their lives. Several were promoted to commissioned
rank in the Field and many others were decorated for
valor. Wherever they went they acquitted themselves in such a
manner that although never to cross the Channel as a Unit, the
40th always received honorable mention in every fighting Unit in
the Canadian Corps.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 64th Battalion was authorized in June, 1915, and mobilized
at Sussex, N.B., August 15th, 1915. It was originally
intended that this should be a Highland Battalion raised in
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; and
having this in view, the officers were selected from the three
provinces proportionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Unit started to recruit, owing to New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island being still busy completing the 55th Battalion,
all the recruits came from Nova Scotia, and eventually, when New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island began sending their quota,
the ranks swelled to over 2,300, whereas the strength of a Battalion
was only about 1,100 all ranks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>On arrival in England, April 9th, the Battalion moved to Bramshott,
where it remained for four weeks. It then moved to Otterpool
for preliminary musketry, proceeding to Lidd for the final
training in that branch. During the stay at Otterpool the Battalion
was attached to the 6th Training Brigade, being inspected by Major-General
Sir Sam Steele, together with the 63rd, 66th and 69th
Battalions. After the inspection Major-General Steele informed
the troops that they were fully equal to any troops he had ever
inspected, but that owing to certain exigencies of the war it was
impracticable to send them to the Front as Units. Next day the
drafting commenced and 198 were sent to the A.S.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>After one week at Lidd an order was received to send to Shorncliffe
all those who had completed musketry. Five hundred other
ranks in charge of Captain Fairweather moved out of camp at
5 a.m. The next week was spent completing musketry, and on the
following Sunday the remainder of the Battalion moved back to
Otterpool. Other drafts were almost immediately called for of
both officers and men.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 3rd the last move was made to Caesar’s Camp near
Folkestone. The remainder of the Battalion was handed over to
the 40th Reserve, and the 64th for all practical purposes ceased to
exist. The O.C. and Staff were employed in winding up the affairs
of the Unit, the other remaining officers being ordered to hold
themselves in readiness to proceed to France.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Every officer of this Unit eventually proceeded to France. Of
the thirty-nine officers the following paid the supreme sacrifice,
namely: Major G. H. Maxwell, Capt. Frank Fairweather, Capt.
J. Hutton Wallace, Lieut. Herbert M. Campbell, Lieut. C. H.
Hobkirk, Lieut. Reary McKay, Lieut. N. H. Wetmore, Lieut. H. A.
McCleave—eight in all. Of the remainder twenty-four were
wounded, only seven escaping the casualty list.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Battalion was undoubtedly one of the best trained Battalions
leaving Canada. Many of its N.C.O.’s finally reached the
Commissioned Ranks, and the Units in France were always pleased
to get a detachment of 64th men.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <em>THE 85th BATTALION, NOVA SCOTIA HIGHLANDERS, AND THE 85th BATTALION BAND.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The first distinctly Highland Battalion to be organized in
Nova Scotia for active service Overseas in the late War was
the 85th Battalion, Nova Scotia Highlanders. The Battalion
was authorized at Ottawa on September 14, 1915, with the appointment
of Lieut.-Colonel Allison H. Borden as Commanding Officer.
Headquarters for organization and mobilization were first established
at the Military Camp, Aldershot, N.S., on September 23,
1915. Recruiting proceeded rapidly, the idea of a distinctly Nova
Scotia Highland Battalion having fired with enthusiasm the people
of the Province, who, true to their ancestral Highland spirit, were
found “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">deas gu cath</span>” (ready for fight). The success of the recruiting
drew an order from Ottawa for Battalion Headquarters to
be transferred to Halifax, and for the Battalion to be mobilized in
full strength and stationed in the Armories. Mobilization resulted
on October 14, 1915, with the 85th Battalion 200 over strength. On
that day occurred the first parade of the Battalion—a memorably
impressive scene and event, by virtue of its contrasts in personnel;
for in all ranks were officers and men who came from every walk
of life, professional and industrial and commercial, with farmers
and manufacturers amongst the officers, while clergymen, college
professors, and teachers paraded shoulder to shoulder in the rank</p>

<p>LIEUT.-COL. A. H. BORDEN, D.S.O.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The 85th Battalion has the distinction of being the senior, and,
as it were, the parent Unit of the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade.
But with the Brigade as such this chapter is not concerned. Its story
has been told incidentally in connection with the other Units which
made up the Brigade. It will suffice to remark, however, that this
magnificent body of fighting men—“the very flower of Nova
Scotia’s manhood”—after being noted by the military leaders and
authorities in England “as the finest body of troops sent over from
Canada,” was, under the exigencies of military supervision, finally
broken up in England, and reorganized into two Battalions, the
85th Battalion, Nova Scotia Highlanders, and the 185th Battalion,
Cape Breton Highlanders. The latter Battalion—“<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">siol nan gaisgeach
mora</span>”—became a splendid Unit in the so-called Fifth
Division, but was denied the privilege and glory of seeing service
in France as a Unit. The record of their compatriots, “D” Company
of the 85th Battalion, at Virny and Passchendaele, a most
glorious record, is sufficient proof that had the 185th Battalion,
Cape Breton Highlanders, got to France as a Unit, the name not
only of Nova Scotia Province but also of the Island of Cape Breton
would to-day be shining with still greater glory than that which
they now possess for brilliant military achievement in the late War.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>As it was, however, the records of individual officers and men of the
185th Battalion who had transferred to the 85th and other Units
on the 185th being broken up just before the initial drive of 1918,
were such as to give a noble name not only to themselves individually,
but also to the 185th Battalion and Cape Breton Island, where
this splendid Unit of fighting men was recruited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reverting now to the 85th Battalion as such, after due training,
and many inexplicable disappointments in earlier sailing for Overseas,
the 85th Battalion, and the other Units of the Nova Scotia
Highland Brigade, broke camp on October 11, 1916, and sailed for
England on October 13, 1916, aboard H.M. Transport <em>Olympic</em>.
The 85th and the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade disembarked at
Liverpool on October 19, 1916, and immediately entrained for
Witley Camp, Surrey, arriving in Camp the same evening. Following
the breaking up of the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade, and the
reorganization of the 85th, the Battalion sailed for France on
February 10, 1917, going into training for service in the Field at
Gouy Servins, Bouvigny, and Bouvigny Wood, from which quarters
the Battalion moved up to Music Hall Line, in the reserves, to
take part as “a working Unit” in the Battle of Vimy Ridge (April
9, 1917).</p>

<p class='c007'>Including Vimy, the 85th Battalion was in the following engagements—Vimy,
April 9 to 14, 1917; “The Triangle,” June 20, 1917;
Ontario Trench, June 26, 1917; Eleu dit Leauvette and the Horse
Shoe, June 28, 1917; Lens, July to October, 1917; Passchendaele,
October 28 to November 2, 1917; Arleux, June, 1918; Fompoux,
July, 1918; Amiens, August 8 to 11, 1918; Arras (Drocourt-Queant
Line), September 2 to 5, 1918; Cambrai (Bourlon), September 25
to October 2, 1918; Valenciennes, November, 1918; Quievrechain,
November, 1918; Honnelle River. November, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the Battalion did after the signing of the Armistice is of
no military significance. It returned from France to England on
May 1, 1919, took part in the Great March of Triumph through
London on May 3, 1919; sailed from England for Canada on May
31, 1919; and arrived at Halifax on June 8. 1919, and two days
later marched through the City of Halifax, which was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</span></i> to
give the Unit a memorably joyous welcome home. It was not, however,
a welcome from the city, but from the whole Province, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>is estimated that 60,000 outside visitors—friends and relatives—of
the returned victors must have been present among the citizens of
Halifax to witness the home-coming parade of the 85th Battalion,
Nova Scotia Highlanders. A week later (June 15, 1919), a
remnant company of the Battalion fell in at Grafton Park, Halifax,
and headed by the Royal Canadian Regiment Band, marched with
its King’s and Regimental Colors to Government House, where the
colors were deposited in the presence of His Honor Lieutenant-Governor
Grant, Colonel W. E. Thompson, D.O.C., M.D. No. 6,
and Staff. On the occasion Lieut.-Col. James Layton Ralston,
C.M.G., D.S.O., with Bar, Commanding the 85th, read an address
of farewell to the officers and N.C.O.’s and men assembled—and
thus the history of the 85th Battalion, Nova Scotia Highlanders, as
a fighting Unit, came to an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the proper places there will be explicit observations on the
achievements of the Battalion, individual officers, N.C.O.’s and men
on the Field. In the meantime, following is a summary of the

<p class='c007'>The first “big show” or engagement in which the 85th Battalion
took part was that of Vimy Ridge. Theirs was not at first an
envious situation. The Battalion had been substituted for another
in the 12th Brigade, but the actual taking over did not ensue till
after the Battle of Vimy Ridge. For that engagement the 85th was
attached to the 11th Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General
Odlum. For the Battle of Vimy Ridge the 85th moved into position
in the reserves, and was to serve as “a working Unit,” that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to follow up the troops in action, and to carry ammunition, build
dugouts, keep up communication trenches, clear wire entanglements,
and in general, as the phrase is, “to mop up.” The 85th, of
course, could be called on, as they were, to fight in an emergency.
But they were regarded as “green troops,” and it was not considered
likely by the authorities that the Battalion would be efficient and
steady under slaughterous fire. As a matter of fact, all the while
between the Battalion’s arrival at Gouy Servins till the Unit moved
out from quarters into the reserve at Music Hall Line for their
part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Col.
A. H. Borden, the Second in Command, Lieut.-Col. E. C.
Phinney, the Adjutant, Major J. L. Ralston, and Assistant
Adjutant, Lieut. A. T. Croft, had been preparing the Battalion as
much for a fighting Unit as for a working Unit—having had the
German lines at Vimy all taped out to scale, and having trained the
Unit in every detail of the coming operation, until all ranks knew
the precise “lay” of the Vimy Front and how the fighting Units as
such would operate in action. Thus considered, the 85th Battalion
was not a Unit of “green troops” in the ordinary acceptance of
the phrase. They were “ready for fight”—and unexpectedly they
got their chance, and achieved to their immortal glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battle of Vimy Ridge opened in the early morn of Easter
Monday, April 9, 1917. At first it was all clear gain for the Canadians.
But, at last, toward the evening, word kept coming back
that the Canadian advance was being held up, that Hill 145 remained
untaken, that it was a “nasty critical situation,” because
the enfilading of the Huns would destroy attacking troops totally,
and that if Hill 145 were not somehow taken, the engagement would
fail. Where were there fresh troops who could be sent in to take
Hill 145? It is understood that Colonel Hilliam, commanding the
25th Battalion, Nova Scotia’s invincible “Shock Troops,” recommended
that the 85th Battalion be selected for the feat. He assured
Brigadier Odlum that even if they were “green troops” they would
be steady under fire. The die was cast. Orders came from headquarters
that two Companies of the 85th were to go into the line at
sundown and assault Hill 145. Lieut.-Col. Borden, Commanding
Officer, selected “C” and “D” Companies, and placed Capt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Percival W. Anderson in command, with Capt. Harvey E. Crowell
in command of “C” Company.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. E. C. PHINNEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At zero hour “C” Company went over the top, followed immediately
by “D” Company, but, for good reasons, without the usual
barrage. The 85th had <em>dared</em>. The question now was on the part
of the Units that had been held up, Would the 85th also <em>DO</em>?
From the moment the Companies went over the top, they proceeded
on to their objective, the crest of Hill 145, with the precision and
steadiness of inured troops. There is no necessity to describe the
assault in detail. But when the Huns first saw the 85th Companies
going over the top, they were amazed. As the Companies proceeded
forward, steady and indomitable in spite of the gun fire and the hail
of bullets from concealed nests of machine guns, the while themselves
wreaking destruction on the Bosche, the Germans became
alarmed. And when the 85th Companies still kept on, in the same
spirit, and with the same effectiveness, the Huns became disconcerted,
and at last ignominiously turned and “beat it,” leaving Hill
145—the Huns’ “pivotal strategic stronghold”—in possession of
the 85th Companies and the Canadian
Corps. The clearing up of the Ridge
and the advance of the 85th Companies
to the Lens-Arras Road need not detain
us. On the morning of April 14, 1917,
the Battalion was relieved by the Royal
Sussex, and marched back to rest quarters
at Bouvigny Huts.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many acts of heroism on
the part of officers, N.C.O.’s and men
during the first day of the Vimy Ridge
“show” and on later days. One phrase
might be applied to summarize the conduct
of the Commanding Officer (Lieutenant-Colonel Borden), the
Second in Command (Lieutenant-Colonel Phinney), and the
Adjutant, Major J. L. Ralston, who had the task of consolidating
the line after the taking of the Ridge; not only were they all the time
“cool, calm and collected,” but the three showed distinct military
genius. Outstanding was the conduct of Capt. Percival W. Anderson,
who, amongst other exploits, single-handed performed a deed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of heroism which won for him the Military Cross (it should have
been the V.C.). One of the men in the patrols suffered a bad
wound. His groans were heard in “No Man’s Land,” but he lay
where the whole field was raked by rifle and machine-gun fire.
Captain Anderson would not ask or command any of his men to
attempt a rescue, but went out himself and carried the wounded
man back to safety. This splendid soldier and officer was killed at
the Battle of Passchendaele, his death profoundly regretted; for he
knew no fear, and he was a superb officer and leader of men, a
splendid example of the Cape Breton Highlander.</p>

<p class='c007'>The list of those who turned exploits and won awards at Vimy
is too long to admit of detailed accounts. But specially to be mentioned
are Capt. H. E. Crowell, Capt. H. B. Clarke, Chaplain, and
later Transport Officer (acting); Lieuts. H. C. Verner (“Hell-Fire”
Verner), Douglas Graham, Hugh A. Crawley, F. C. Manning;
and amongst the privates and N.C.O.’s—Pte. C. A. McLeod, Pte.
H. C. Steeves, Pte. A. J. Murphy, Pte. J. S. Westlake, Pte. L. M.
Gates, Pte. K. Manoles, Pte. J. C. Taylor, Pte. C. J. Doucette,
Runners, Ptes. W. E. Stackhouse, W. W. Pearson and G. B. Peck;
Lance-Corporal A. F. MacAree, Lance-Corporal V. M. Lindsay,
Lance-Corporal H. W. Hardy, Corporal C. D. Reid, and Sergt.
W. U. Martel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The courage, pluck, indomitableness and resourcefulness of the
officers, N.C.O.’s and men of the 85th Battalion at the Battle of
Vimy Ridge were instanced not to glorify the Battalion, but to
show forth the kind of “stuff” that was the spirit of the Unit.
The same kind of spirit was shown in all subsequent engagements—“The
Triangle,” Ontario Trench, Eleu dit Leauvette and the Horse
Shoe and around Lens, up to Passchendaele. The outstanding
phase of the long Battle of Passchendaele (October 28 to November
2, 1917) was the recapturing of the front line by “D” Company
(Cape Bretoners), commanded by Captain Ross M. MacKenzie—another
“saving of the day,” as at Vimy, by the 85th Battalion.
The 85th was, as decided, to be in the line for a day before going
over the top. However, before that move, “D” Company was to
take over the whole Battalion frontage, the other Companies to
remain at the rear. A Western Canadian Unit was in the line, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>just as “D” Company reached the line for the relief of the Western
Battalion, the Huns launched a violent and destructive counter-attack.
Captain MacKenzie and “D” Company saw that the
Western Battalion was falling back, and the Huns advancing in
great force. It was a critical situation, and Captain MacKenzie at
once offered himself and his Company to reinforce the retiring
Unit. The offer was gladly accepted. Captain MacKenzie ordered
his Company to drop all kit, and to fix bayonets and advance in
true Highland fashion. With huzzas they made for the enemy—dashing
upon the Huns with such a rush and momentum, that the
Huns became bewildered, next were seized with panic, broke, and
“beat it.” The situation was saved, and the line recaptured
shortly by continued advance to the position from which the
Western Battalion was forced to retire. But that advance was
costly in casualties, for it was covered by enemy machine guns and
snipers’ posts. Then it was that the ancient fighting spirit of his
Gaelic ancestors shone brilliantly in Captain MacKenzie, and he
became the Gaelic Hero Cuchullain in the fight and in death.
MacKenzie was shot through the abdomen—some say he was literally
riddled—with machine gun bullets, and he fell. But he
struggled to his feet and kept on with his Company, bleeding to
death, and commanded his men, encouraging them, until he dropped
exhausted into a shell hole. Even then, though undone, he would
not be attended to, but kept encouraging his Company. Eventually
he permitted himself to be placed on a stretcher, and while being
borne away, he died—like Cuchullain too, unconquerable in death.
There were many other individual examples of heroism on that
day and during the days that followed at Passchendaele. But the
slaughter was awful: and while the engagement added fresh glory
to the 85th Battalion, and is a memorial to the living, it is to be
regarded as an apotheosis of all 85th officers, non-commissioned
officers and men who fell at that mysteriously ordered engagement—Major
P. W. Anderson, M.C., Capts. John M. Hensley, E. R.
Clayton, M.C., and Ross M. MacKenzie, Lieuts. Walter U. Martel,
M.M., Frank O. Hutchison, Angus D. MacDonald, Norman C.
Christie, Alexander D. Fraser, Fred J. Anderson, John R. MacFarlane,
W. H. Murr and R. Salisman, and the 123 privates and
non-commissioned officers. It was for their bravery and resourcefulness
and indomitableness—their sheer invincibility—at Passchendaele
that the 85th Battalion won from the other Units in the
Canadian Corps and the Imperials the noteworthy, if slangy,
complimentary epithet, “The Never Fails.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>From Passchendaele to the signing of the Armistice would
furnish only repetitions of the records of the 85th Battalion in
action. It was all a most honorable and glorious record, quite
worthy to stand beside that of Canadian Units which had seen
longer service. It would not do, however, to bring this summary
narrative to a close without mentioning the characteristics of the
outstanding officers, but for whom the 85th would not have been a
reality, or would not have achieved so splendidly. First, let it be
remembered perennially that all honor and distinction belongs to
Lieut.-Col. Allison H. Borden for conceiving the idea of a distinctly
Nova Scotia Highland Battalion, and, later, a distinctly Nova
Scotia Highland Brigade. As an officer he always displayed vision
and decision, great gifts for organization; and in the Field he was
a gallant and resourceful soldier, to whom the loss of men in action
was felt as a poignant personal loss. He was awarded the Distinguished
Service Order. But posterity will gratefully remember
him and honor his name as the Organizer and Commanding Officer
of the 85th Battalion, Nova Scotia Highlanders, and the Organizer
and Brigadier of the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade. Lieut.-Col.
Earle C. Phinney was a young officer, and, in turn, filled several
positions from Adjutant to Commanding Officer in Canada and in
England, and had the honor of taking the 85th to France, where,
though he had voluntarily reverted to Second in Command, he was
temporarily in Command till the arrival of Lieut.-Colonel Borden.
He made a record at Vimy for coolness and resourcefulness in the
Field. In a later engagement he was wounded, and was eventually
invalided home. Lieut.-Col. J. L. Ralston, who brought the 85th
home, as Commanding Officer, also served as Adjutant and as
Commanding Officer in the Field. He was his officers’ and men’s
ideal of “the splendid soldier,” intrepid and indomitable, and
always resourceful. He was wounded several times: and was
awarded the D.S.O. and Bar to the D.S.O., and honored by the
King with the C.M.G. Lieut.-Col. Joseph Hayes was unique as an
officer. He was the M.O. of the Battalion, and a more humane and
intrepid M.O. there was not in the Canadian Corps. Though several
years past the age limit, he never missed a day from the line from
Vimy to Passchendaele, and did much to keep up the morale and
fighting spirit of the officers and men of the 85th. In a phrase,
Lieut.-Col. Joseph Hayes was a gallant officer, a genuinely brave
soldier, and a humane and kind medical expert in the line. The
hygiene of the Battalion, which was a record in the Canadian Corps,
was due to Colonel Hayes’ rigorous supervision of camp and line
sanitation and his meticulous care of the person, food and potables
of the officers and men. He was awarded the D.S.O. It is impossible
to make a “Homeric Catalogue” of the character and
deeds of all the other officers. Suffice it to say that they all were
good men and true. The Battalion had the distinction of having
Sir Robert Borden, Premier of Canada, as Honorary Colonel.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><em>85th BATTALION BRASS AND REED BAND.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>The literary and the musical professions were well represented
in the personnel of the 85th Battalion—by one
historian, two poets, and a brass and wood-wind band, an
organization of instrumentalists that gave the Battalion additional
and peculiar distinction and glory. Lieut.-Colonel Hayes in England
and France acted as a free-lance war correspondent and, on arrival
home, set to work to prepare the History of the 85th Battalion. He
produced an illustrated work of nearly 400 pages—a most readable
volume, the first history of any Nova Scotia fighting Unit that had
taken part in the late War. It was hurriedly prepared, under very
difficult conditions, but despite a minimum of slight and inevitable
discrepancies or omissions—every history from Thucydides to John
Richard Green has these—it is a well-written and accurate work,
a genuine monument to the literary acumen and devotion of that
versatile and gallant officer, Lieut.-Col. Joseph Hayes. The two
poets were the late Lieut. Frederick C. Manning, a brilliant alumnus
of Acadia University, whose “Poems” were posthumously published.
They are excellent poems, both in conception and in craftsmanship,
and go to prove how great a wastage of brain power and
rare spirit was caused by the late War. The other poet was Sergt.
J. D. Logan, an alumnus of Harvard University. He was a free-lance
war correspondent at the Front. He published two volumes
of war poems—“Insulters of Death and Other Poems of the Great
Departure” (1916), and “The New Apocalypse and Other Poems
of Days and Deeds in France” (1919), besides a series of magazine
articles on special phases of the War, a series entitled “From Vimy
to Passchendaele” (1918), and before sailing for Overseas a
pamphlet on the 85th Band (“Canada’s Champion Regimental
Band”). All this is mentioned to show that military training for
active warfare and actual warfare do not necessarily kill the finer
spirit of men or turn soldiers from human beings into brutes. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the chief aesthetic glory of the 85th Battalion was its extraordinary
fine marching and symphonic band. Following are the salient facts
in its history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The band was the descendant of the old Albion Mines (Stellarton)
Band, established in the ’40’s of the last century, and having
a continuous history of nearly three-quarters of a century to date.
It was for years the regimental band of the 78th Pictou Highlanders.
Lieut.-Colonel Borden, commanding the 85th, asked Lieut.
Dan. Mooney, bandmaster of the Stellarton or 78th Band, to
organize a band for the 85th. The original personnel of the 85th
Band, the personnel which went Overseas with the Battalion, was:
Lieut. Dan. Mooney, Bandmaster; Sergt. J. C. Profitt, Corpls.
W. D. MacLeod and Alex. Myers, Ptes. A. H. MacDougall, R. H.
Roy, Ronald MacDougall, E. B. Mitchell (did not sail), R. Y.
Geddes, C. A. MacDonald, A. J. Fraser, T. R. Roy, J. W. Henderson,
T. B. Davidson (died in France), C. W. Appleton, H. P.
Barnes, F. T. Freeman, J. J. Gray, T. Mason, C. A. (“Chud”)
MacDonald, A. R. MacDonald, A. A. MacDougall, J. R. Munro,
H. H. Murray, C. E. Purves, G. A. Rackham, W. D. Jamieson,
F. A. Ryan, W. P. Cameron, Joseph Smith, James Roy, D. W.
Cameron, W. E. Gallagher, F. D. Mooney, A. F. Gallant, W. Dunn
(did not sail, died later), Sergt. J. D. Logan.</p>

<p class='c007'>This band was distinguished in musicianship by <em>versatility</em>, <em>virtuosity</em>
and <em>brilliancy</em>. It had acquired a notable reputation for these
qualities in Canada, and when Overseas, in England, where it was in
demand by towns near Camp Witley, for social functions of a semi-military
or war-propaganda nature. The Director of Musical
Services, who came to Camp Witley, to hear and conduct the band
at rehearsal said of it, in writing: “<em>It is the best band that has
come Overseas from Canada</em>,” and remarked specially on its precision
in attack, its unanimity, its dynamic qualities and nuancing,
and its brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, bands in camp and rest quarters are regarded as good for
the morale of Units, but generally were considered as impedimenta
(or superfluous baggage) with a Unit active in the Field. But the
officers and men of the 85th were insistent in their outspoken
demand—“We want our band.” The problem was how to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the band from being broken up, and how to get the bandsmen, with
their instruments, into France. It was achieved by the characteristic
resourcefulness of the Commanding Officer and officers. When
the 85th crossed to France the band was not on the establishment.
The bandsmen, however, were brought over on the strength as
fighting men, and the instruments came along too, somehow mysteriously,
as part of the Quartermaster’s stores (Capt. Robert
Donaldson was Quartermaster—and a kinder and more resourceful
Quartermaster there was not in the Canadian Corps). The bandsmen
and their instruments being in France, their fixed place on
the establishment of the Battalion was finally adjusted by the
authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fame of this band soon spread throughout the 4th Division
and the Canadian Corps, and into England; and it became a matter
of perpetual demand for the 85th Band to be present and to play at
concert parties and at parades and other functions of the Division
and Brigade. This was due more particularly to the versatility of the
band in <em>soloists</em> and a <em>group of entertainers</em> amongst the personnel,
who formed a concert party by themselves. It is without question
that Thomas Roy, euphonium soloist; Percival Barnes, piccolo and
flute soloist; R. MacDougall and D. W. Cameron, cornet soloists;
J. C. Profitt and Alex. Myers, clarinet soloists; Alex. (“Attell”)
MacDougall, trombone soloist, and the trombone quartet (A. MacDougall,
J. J. Gray, C. E. Purves, and James Roy) were as expert
instrumentalists as the trained ear could wish to hear. They
earned for the band its name for virtuosity and brilliancy. The
group of entertainers comprised H. H. Murray, George Rackham,
Frank (“Hunk”) A. Ryan, C. W. Appleton and Ronald MacDougall.
Murray was vocal soloist, with band accompaniment,
having a rounded cantabile baritone. He was also “the lead” in
the theatrical entertainment, sketches and vaudeville, with Rackham
as foil. Ryan, Appleton and R. MacDougall were step dancers,
and Ryan was noted for his eccentric dancing specialties. The
group, assisted by the other members of the band, also produced
“The Old Homestead,” in costume, at the Front.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day of the Great March of Triumph through London,
May 3, 1919, the 85th Band made a distinct popular “hit” with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the Londoners. The Director of Musical Services, noted the fact
in the following official communication:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 106th Battalion, Nova Scotia Rifles, was authorized on
November 8, 1915, and recruiting commenced at once. Being
the first Rifle Battalion recruited in the Maritime Provinces,
it appealed strongly to the members of the various rifle clubs and
was soon up to strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>The standards of the Battalion were
high. Regimental schools for the training
of non-commissioned officers were
established. The motto of the Battalion
was “None So Reliable,” and all ranks
sought to make the Battalion worthy to
bear such a name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Headquarters were established at
Truro, where two Companies were stationed;
the other two Companies were
stationed at Springhill and Truro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion left Canada July 15, 1916, and encamped at Lower
Dibgate, Shorncliffe, England. There it met the fate of many other
Canadian Units, by being broken up into drafts to reinforce Battalions
in the Field.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <em>112th BATTALION, C.E.F.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Authority for the recruiting of the 112th Battalion, with
headquarters in the historic town of Windsor, N.S., was
granted in November, 1915. Its personnel was composed of
officers and men drawn chiefly from the western part of Nova
Scotia, embracing the counties of Halifax, Hants, Kings, Annapolis,
Digby, Yarmouth, Shelburne, Queens and Lunenburg. Recruiting
progressed with unique rapidity and by the middle of April, 1916,
the Battalion was at full strength. Over 1,500 men applied for
enlistment, and of these about 300 were found medically unfit.
The significance of this achievement will be seen when it is considered
that it was accomplished without the aid of any extensive
recruiting campaign, but by the united effort of each officer and
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early days of the Unit each county was allowed to keep a
detachment, providing it numbered fifty men or more, who trained
in their own locality until finally mobilized in Windsor in May, 1916.
There the Battalion encamped on the hill of Fort Edward, where
it was subjected to a rigorous training, and the progress made
elicited much praise from Major-General Sir Sam Hughes, then
Minister of Militia, who inspected the Unit about the beginning of
July, 1916. The period of training at Windsor was one of keen
enjoyment to all concerned. Its discipline was stern, its experience
was at times hard, but the life was altogether wholesome and
profitable, which was evidenced by the improvement in the bearing
and appearance of the Unit during its short stay at Windsor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was commanded by Lieut.-Col. H. B. Tremaine.
The other officers were: Majors W. F. D. Brennan, second in command;
T. M. Seely, M. S. Parker, T. A. Mulock; Capts. R. W.
Churchill, O. G. Dauphinee (killed in action), R. T. Christie,

<p class='c007'>Capt. G. R. Martell, Rector of Christchurch, Windsor, N.S.,
and Chaplain of the Battalion throughout its organization, did
splendid work in recruiting and was beloved by all ranks. Owing
to his inability to proceed Overseas, the Rev. Charles R. Cummings
was appointed Chaplain and held the position until transferred to
hospital duty in England preparatory to proceeding to the Chaplain
Services in France in January, 1917.
Captain Martell died in June, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colors for the 112th Battalion were
made by Mrs. Annie Pratt, of Windsor,
Nova Scotia, and were presented to the
Battalion by Mrs. Tremaine, wife of the
Commanding Officer, on Friday afternoon,
July 21, 1916. The Battalion was
formed up in mass in front of the bandstand
at Victoria Park, Windsor, and
addresses were delivered by the Chaplain,
Mayor Roach, and others. The next day
the colors were deposited in Christchurch,
Windsor, where the officers and men attended divine
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 112th Battalion embarked at Halifax, July 23, 1916, on
<em>H.M.T. Olympic</em>, and arrived at Liverpool on July 31st. Here it
entrained and proceeded to Oxney Farm near Bramshott. The
Unit remained there for about three weeks, after which it moved to
Bramshott on the departure of the 4th Division for France. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Bramshott the Battalion was put through very intensive training,
and on October 5th the first draft of 122 other ranks left for France
to reinforce the 25th Battalion. On October 10th, 212 other ranks
and on October 29th, 40 other ranks were sent to the 25th Battalion,
all of whom proved to be a very welcome acquisition to that
famous Unit. Other drafts found their way to the Royal Canadian
Regiment. Most of the officers were detailed to special schools in
various parts of England for a time, after which they were gradually
absorbed by the Battalions already at the Front. At one time it
was expected that the Battalion would become a Forestry Unit and
be sent to France, but for some reason this did not eventuate, and
the Battalion was gradually depleted until the remnant was finally
merged into the 26th Canadian Reserve Battalion in February, 1917.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>It is a difficult task indeed to compress a history of the 185th
Battalion into the space allotted for the purpose in this book.
It is a difficult task, because, if we exclude those Battalions that
saw active service as complete Units, the history of the 185th is
longer than that of any other Nova Scotia Battalion. It is a
difficult task because, through this long association and through the
high standard of efficiency to which the
Battalion attained, there grew up between
all ranks a spirit of pride in their Unit
and of affectionate regard for each other,
which may be fairly said to be almost
unique, and which deserves a monument
much grander and more enduring than
this sketch can hope to raise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The origin of the 185th may be said
to be in the 85th Nova Scotia Highland
Battalion, recruited by Lieut.-Col. A. H.
Borden in the autumn of 1915. The
enthusiasm with which the people of
Nova Scotia hailed the advent of the 85th Battalion engendered the
more ambitious idea of a Nova Scotia Highland Brigade, and in the
months of February and March, 1916, there was conducted in Nova
Scotia a recruiting campaign for the raising of three additional
Battalions, to form, with the 85th, a complete Brigade. The remarkable
success of that campaign is now part of our Nova Scotian
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Island of Cape Breton was given the task of raising a
Battalion, to be known as the 185th and to be under the command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of Lieut.-Col. F. P. Day (then Major Day) of the 85th Battalion.
Though Cape Breton had already given men to the colors, in
numbers far in excess of her due proportion, nevertheless, the
prospect of seeing active service with a Unit distinctly and entirely
Cape Breton, so fired the imagination of the young men of the
Island that in three weeks the Battalion was recruited to full
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system of recruiting employed was well calculated to obtain
the best results. First, the officers were selected. Some of them
were Cape Bretoners, serving with the 85th Battalion, a few came
from the Officers’ Training Corps of the Colleges, but the majority
were drawn from the 94th, the Cape Breton Militia Unit. These
officers were sent out into their own native districts to recruit men
for their own Companies or Platoons, and the assurance was given
that men from the same locality would be placed together in the
same Company, Platoon, or Section as the case might be, and under
an officer from that locality. That assurance was kept sacredly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The motto selected for the Battalion was the same as that of
the 85th—“<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Siol Na Fear Fearail</span>”—“Seed of Manly Men.” That
motto was highly appropriate, for the ranks of the Battalion were
in large part filled by descendants of Highlanders—those manly
men who peopled Cape Breton in late 18th and early 19th centuries.
To the Highland element in the population of Cape Breton the 185th
made its greatest appeal, for the promise had been given that the
Battalion should wear Highland garb, and the prospect of joining
a Unit which should be clad in that picturesque and historic dress
undoubtedly touched the Highland imagination. But the other
races did not lag behind. The French, Irish and English elements
were well represented, and there were not a few recruits of Italian
and Russian extraction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A” Company of the 185th came from the counties of Inverness,
Victoria and Richmond; “B” Company from Glace Bay and
New Waterford; “C” Company from North Sydney and Sydney
Mines; and “D” Company from Sydney. Broughton, eighteen
miles from Sydney, was chosen as a mobilization centre, and there
the Battalion assembled during the first week of April, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Broughton, three bands, Pipe, Brass and Bugle were organized.
The citizens of Glace Bay, the Royal Cape Breton Yacht
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Club, the “Green Feather” Societies of North Sydney and Sydney
Mines, and Mr. Thomas Cantley, of New Glasgow, each presented
four pipes and three drums to the Battalion. Money for the purchase
of instruments for the Brass Band was subscribed by the
citizens of Sydney. For the Regimental March, the stirring Highland
air, “A Hundred Pipers,” was chosen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton did not offer a suitable ground for advanced
training; and so on May 26th, 1916, the Battalion entrained for
Aldershot, N.S., where the Highland Brigade was to spend the
summer of 1916, under the command of Lieut.-Col. A. H. Borden,
who had recruited and commanded the 85th Battalion. The other
Battalions of the Brigade were the 85th, 193rd and the 219th.
During the summer the Brigade was reviewed by H.R.H. the Duke
of Connaught, Governor-General of Canada; by Sir Sam Hughes,
Canadian Minister of Militia; by Major-General Lessard, Inspector-General
for Canada. It was twice reviewed by Sir Robert Borden,
Prime Minister of Canada. On the last visit of Sir Robert Borden,
he was accompanied by Lady Borden, who presented colors to the
Battalion. The colors are of beautiful design, rich material and
elegant workmanship. They were received on behalf of the
Battalion by Major Harrington and Lieutenants Purves and Livingstone,
and were blessed by Capt. Michael Gillis, Roman Catholic
Chaplain to the Battalion. (The colors were taken to England with
the Battalion and after the War were returned to Canada, deposited
in the Cape Breton County Court House at Sydney.)</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 4th the Battalion underwent successfully at the
hands of Major-General Lessard its last inspection in Canada.
Preparations for embarking for England were begun and on October
11th the 185th bade good-bye to Aldershot and entrained for
Halifax. That evening they marched on board “His Majesty’s
Transport, 2810,” the war-time designation of the great steamship
<em>Olympic</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>At five o’clock on the evening of October 13th the <em>Olympic</em>
steamed out of Halifax Harbor, bearing the Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade, surely the most precious cargo that Nova Scotia ever
entrusted to the mighty Atlantic. The docks at Halifax were
thronged on that day with thousands of people from all parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Nova Scotia who had come to say good-bye—in many cases unfortunately
a last good-bye—to relatives and friends. Nova Scotia
loves her own, sorrows over their departure from her bosom, and
watches their fortunes under foreign skies with a fond eye and an
anxious heart. I was told in London that, after any battle in which
Canadian troops had taken part, there were more enquiries at Canadian
Headquarters in London, from Nova Scotians, than from
people of any other Province of Canada. I could well believe this
to have been so, for in Nova Scotia character, friendship and
loyalty to kith and kin are outstanding characteristics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers of the 185th at the time of sailing for England were
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>The voyage from Halifax to Liverpool was made in a little
over five days. The Battalion disembarked on the morning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>October 19th, the Pipe Band playing the men down the gangway.
Immediately the train was taken to Witley Camp, which was
reached after a journey of eight hours. Here the Battalion settled
down to work as part of the 12th Canadian Infantry Training
Brigade, which name replaced the old name, “Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In early December there came tidings which nearly every Canadian
Battalion that ever went to England had grown to dread.
The Battalion was called on to supply a draft of 192 men for
France. The other Battalions of the Brigade had received similar
orders, the total number of men required from the Brigade being
800. The call for these drafts seemed to spell the disruption of
the Brigade, notwithstanding promises to the contrary in Canada.
The strongest protests were made by officers of the Brigade, but to
no avail. On December 5th the drafts set out for Southampton
whence they were to embark for Havre. The 185th sent 20 men
to the 42nd (Montreal) Battalion, and 172 men to the 73rd
Battalion, also of Montreal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each Battalion of the Brigade had now been considerably
reduced in strength, and the Canadian authorities in England
decided to amalgamate the 219th with the 85th Battalion, and the
193rd with the 185th Battalion. Officers and men in any one of
these four Units who were not physically fit were sent to the 17th
Nova Scotia Reserve Battalion at Bramshott. The Nova Scotia
Highland Brigade was no more, and the hope in every heart now
was that the two Battalions—85th and 185th—which constituted
what was left of that Brigade, might reach France as Units.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the amalgamation of the 193rd, the officers of the 185th
were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time the Battalion received permission to use as its
official name, “185th Canadian Infantry Battalion (Cape Breton
Highlanders),” instead of “185th Canadian Infantry Battalion,”
as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the spring of 1917, the 5th Canadian Division was organized
at Witley Camp, under the command of Major-General Garnet
Hughes, who had already won high distinction in France. The
185th was given a place in that Division. The Division was
assured that it would be sent to France, and in that hope it set to
work with such earnestness that in the summer of 1917 it was
regarded as one of the most efficient Divisions that had ever
trained in England. The 185th by hard and persevering work had
won the reputation of being unexcelled, and by many unbiased
observers it was regarded as unequalled, in the whole Division.
Certainly, the Battalion was often specially complimented by
Inspecting Officers and was often singled out for particular honor.
At the great Dominion Day Parade in London, in 1917, the Guard
of Honor for the Colors was drawn from the 185th. Again and
again its teams won from other Battalion teams in competitions in
Musketry, Bayonet Fighting, Physical Training, Drill and Machine
Gun Work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>From the first the men had looked forward eagerly to the day
when kilts would be issued to the Battalion. Their wish was
realized in August, 1917, when kilts of the Argyll and Sutherland
tartan were authorized to be worn, and sufficient kilts were sent to
the Quartermaster to clothe the whole Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reference has been made already to the promise given to the
5th Division that it would go to France intact. That promise was
repeated several times, and the hope that it would be kept was the
only ground on which men could be induced to remain contentedly
in England. But no phrase has done better service during the War
than the phrase “military exigencies,” and it was invoked once
again to justify the disbanding of the 5th Division in February,
1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coincident with the breakup of the Division came the order to
the 185th to furnish a draft of two officers and one hundred men
to each of the three Nova Scotian Battalions in France—the 25th,
85th and R.C.R. All the men at once volunteered. Sergeants
reverted to the rank of private in order to get to France more
quickly; Colonels reverted and became Majors; Majors became
Captains and Captains Subalterns. The drafts for France were
finally selected, and the rest of the Battalion was ordered to be sent
to Bramshott, to be absorbed by the 17th Reserve. On February
23rd the Battalion paraded for the last time, the drafts for France
stood fast, the draft for Bramshott swung out on the London-Portsmouth
Road, the pipers played their last march, and the 185th
passed out of existence as an Overseas Unit forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is idle now to lament its unhappy fate, or to deplore the
peculiar policy that was pursued toward it and other Battalions of
the 5th Division, but Cape Bretoners everywhere will always have
difficulty in restraining a regretful sigh over the lot of their own
and only Battalion. Let it always be remembered, however, that
through no fault of its own did the 185th fail to reach France as a
Unit. It kept faith with the people of Cape Breton, and it established
a standard which any Battalion might be proud to emulate.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though there never fell to this Battalion the supreme honor
of battle or the glory of triumph, its individual members went
forth to war, stronger in training, in discipline, in comradeship and
in spirit from their association with the Cape Breton Highlanders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Every officer of the Battalion saw service in some theatre of war,
and five of them now sleep on the field of honor—Lieutenants
Fraser, Holland, MacIvor, Livingstone and J. O. MacLeod. Nearly
every other officer of the Battalion has been wounded, and several
have been decorated for bravery. Of the men it is enough to say
that incomplete returns show that 136 of them fell in action. On
their graves may the turf lie lightly. Truer hearts or more gallant
spirits never fought for any cause, and to them we may be sure that
every Cape Breton tongue will apply with heartfelt sincerity the
words that have been chosen for the crosses that will mark the
graves of British soldiers buried in France—“Their Name Liveth
Forevermore.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 193rd Battalion was authorized on January 27, 1916,
and John Stanfield, M.P. for Colchester, in the Dominion
House of Commons, was gazetted Lieut.-Colonel and
appointed Commanding Officer.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>For a few weeks following this date the 193rd Battalion was not
regarded as a Highland Brigade Battalion, but on February 23,
1916, Lieut.-Colonel Stanfield was officially
notified that the 193rd had been
selected as one of the Brigade Units.</p>

<p class='c007'>Organization for recruiting had
already been effected, and the 193rd was
in a position to join in the Brigade campaign
at once. The territory of the
Battalion embraced the six Eastern
Counties of the Mainland—Cumberland,
Colchester, Hants, Pictou, Antigonish
and Guysboro, with headquarters at
Truro. Within one month the Battalion
was over strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 24th Capt. J. L. Ralston, of the 85th Battalion,
reported for duty as Acting Adjutant. His assistance was invaluable
and counted for much in these early days of organization.
Capt. J. Welsford MacDonald relieved him on April 7th and was
appointed Adjutant. He was later succeeded by Capt. F. B.
Schurman.</p>

<p class='c007'>In February Lieut.-Colonel Stanfield had asked for the services
of Capt. R. J. S. Langford, of the Royal Canadian Regiment,
Halifax. On April 18th Captain Langford was attached to the
193rd, with the rank of Major, was appointed second in command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and took over the duties of officer in charge of training. The high
standard of efficiency to which the Battalion later attained was
brought about by Major Langford’s enthusiastic and unremitting
efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mobilization of the Battalions of the Highland Brigade at
Camp Aldershot in May, 1916, is dealt with elsewhere in this
volume. The 193rd arrived in Camp 300
men over strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in September the Brigadier,
Lieut.-Colonel Borden, left for England,
and was succeeded in the command of
the Brigade by Lieut.-Colonel Stanfield.
Major Langford took over the command
of the Battalion with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>On September 26th, Lady Borden,
wife of the Premier of Canada, presented
King’s and Regimental Colors
to the four Battalions of the Brigade.
The distinctive color selected by the 193rd was “Royal Blue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion embarked on the <em>Olympic</em>, October 12th. The

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In the limited space allowed for this article it is necessary to
omit references to the stirring events which marked the recruiting
of the Battalions of the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade, the
185th in Cape Breton, the 193rd in Pictou, Colchester, Cumberland
and Hants Counties, and the 219th in Halifax and the Western
Counties of the Province. Each contributed to the popular
enthusiasm, and through the agency of
the press any unusual success in one part
was heralded throughout the Province
and bore fruit in distant sections.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Halifax and the Western Counties,
while there were many agencies at
work, too numerous to mention, they
naturally centred around the extraordinary
series of meetings addressed by
Colonel Borden and Captain Cutten,
when, accompanied by the 85th Band,
they made their historic tour, commencing
at Lunenburg on February 26, 1916,
and ending at Wolfville on March 12th. They touched at all the
chief points on the Halifax and South Western Railway and returned
by the Dominion Atlantic as far as Wolfville. While active
recruiting in many places had preceded and prepared for their
arrival, the extraordinary enthusiasm aroused by their speeches and
by the martial strains of the band formed an epoch in each community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recruits enrolled were billeted in their own towns, and detachments
marched into Camp Aldershot on June 1st from Lunenburg,

of the 219th. Lieut. C. Holland was appointed Acting
Adjutant. For some time the orders were chiefly concerned with
the large accessions to the strength of the Battalion, daily reported,
as the result of Colonel Borden’s successful tour, and the formation
of the various detachments. These recruits were now arranged in
four companies, “A” in Halifax, “B” comprising the territory
from Mahone Bay to Clarke’s Harbor, “C” from Yarmouth to Bear
River, and “D” from Annapolis to Wolfville.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first public parade of “A” Company was on May 27th
to St. Matthew’s Church to attend the memorial service for Lieutenant
Campbell, who had been killed in action, and who was the
son of Mr. G. S. Campbell, one of the most active spirits in the
recruiting campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the history of the 219th there is a humorous distinction
between the first funeral procession and the first actual funeral of
one of its members. One night in the early spring a fire occurred
in a house in Barrington Street. Unfortunately the inmates could
not be extricated in time, and some fatalities resulted. The charred
remains of one body was identified as that of Metrofan Meik, a
Russian recruit in the 219th. The funeral took place from St.
Mary’s Cathedral. A firing party was furnished by “C” Company
of the 85th. The Last Post was sounded and full military honors
paid to the dead. Next morning who should report in the orderly
room but Metrofan himself, very much alive and feeling greatly the
better for his leave, which had now expired. Who it was that was
buried with military honors has never been discovered to this hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first actual funeral of a soldier in the 219th took place on
May 2nd, from the Military Hospital in Halifax. The deceased
was Private Edwards, a native of England. The services were
conducted by Hon. Captain MacKinnon.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on Wednesday, February 23rd, that a letter came from
Ottawa authorizing the formation of the 219th and granting permission
to appoint Major E. C. Phinney, of the 85th as temporary O.C.
It was he who had the task of organizing the 219th, and the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in which he accomplished this is a fine tribute to his executive
ability. For the first few days he was assisted by Lieut. C. Holland,
who acted as Adjutant. In the beginning of April a rumor was
in circulation that the Highland Brigade was not to materialize and
that the 85th was to proceed immediately Overseas. Rather than
miss this opportunity of going to the Front, Major Phinney relinquished
his position as Commanding Officer of the 219th and went
back to his former position in the 85th.</p>

<p class='c007'>On April 8th Lieut.-Col. N. H. Parsons became temporary C.O.
of the 219th. He planned a tour of inspection, but his purpose was
frustrated by a serious illness. Lieutenant Holland, who afterwards
became Staff Captain in the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade,
was succeeded as Acting Adjutant by Lieut. John S. Roper. He
along with Major Rudland and Lieutenant Wylie had been one of
a Military Committee to assist in the formation of the Battalion.
He remained Adjutant throughout its whole history.</p>

<p class='c007'>By May 4th Colonel Parsons felt sufficiently recovered to proceed
with his tour of inspection, and during his absence the duties
of command devolved on Major H. D. Creighton. But the atmosphere
was surcharged with uncertainty and the Battalion was
beginning to suffer for want of a permanent head. Lieut.-Col.
Parsons returned to the 85th, and, with him, Major Creighton. At
last on May 5th, Lieut.-Col. W. H. Muirhead assumed command.
Immediately the unrest ceased, and the Battalion settled itself to the
business of training.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the outbreak of the War Colonel Muirhead went at once to
the new camp at Valcartier and was given an appointment on the
Divisional Headquarters Staff. But being unmarried and anxious
to take his part in the actual fighting, he transferred to the Royal
Canadian Dragoons before the First Canadian Contingent sailed,
reverting to the rank of Lieutenant. Early in May, 1915, he crossed
to France in the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, which included, with
the Dragoons, the Strathcona Horse and the 2nd King Edward
Horse. For nine months he was in the trenches, and witnessed
some of the fiercest fighting of the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Canada the idea was gaining ground that new troops should
be instructed in the latest methods of warfare, and this could only
be done by bringing some of the officers from the Front. Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Muirhead was subsequently appointed second in command of the
112th, which was recruiting at the time, and he returned in January,
1916. As above stated he took over the 219th on May 5th. His
keen intelligence, long familiarity with business methods, together
with the stern experience he had known at the Front, fitted him in
quite an exceptional manner for the command and training of a
Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalions at Camp Aldershot were arranged in order of
seniority. Nearest to Aldershot Station was placed the 85th, and
then in order the 185th, 193rd and 219th. Beyond the lines of the
219th were quartered the 97th, “The American Legion,” made up
of men from the United States, who had come to take their share in
the fight for the freedom of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the season the waste land beyond the 97th was cleared
and became the home of the 246th, the reserve Unit of the Brigade.
It might be of interest to mention that the Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade wore Balmoral caps with feathers. The feathers were dark
gray, but each one of them had a distinctive coloring. In the 85th,
it was red; in the 185th, green; in the 193rd, blue; and in the 219th,
purple.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally changes took place in the personnel of the officers of
the 219th, especially late in the season, when the 246th was formed.
But the following list represents with fair accuracy the situation
during most of the summer:</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to these officers were Lieut. H. A. Love in charge of
Signalling Section, and Lieut. W. L. Black of the Machine Gun
Section.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the summer Hon. Captain Father O’Sullivan was added.
He was employed most of the time in raising the “Purple Feather
Fund,” and spent only a week or two in camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was fortunate in its Sergeant-Major, A. S. Ward,
who blended a strict sense of duty with a genial disposition and
secured alike the approbation of the officers and the respect of the
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Camp had not been long established at Aldershot when it
was honored by a visit from Sir Sam Hughes, the Minister of
Militia. On June 11th, at 6 a.m. the Brigade was paraded. Although
there had only been a few days of united training, the
impression produced upon the Minister was quite noticeable, and
ever afterwards he showed a kindly appreciation of the Nova Scotia
Highlanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 9th the Camp was honored by another distinguished
visitor, Sir Robert Borden, the Premier of Canada, who was accompanied
by the Hon. David MacKeen, the Lieut.-Governor of Nova
Scotia. The March Past was excellent, and the Premier, a native
of the Province, was pleased to speak words of heartfelt appreciation
and encouragement. Another inspection was made on August
15th, but this was more of a formal military character and lacked
the general significance of the previous reviews.</p>

<p class='c007'>The red-letter days of the Brigade’s whole history at Aldershot
were Friday the 25th and Saturday the 26th of August. On Friday
the Camp was thrown open to the public, who flocked thither from
every part of the Province. The resources of the railway were
taxed to the utmost. Fully eight thousand people visited the
grounds and witnessed the March Past. They were relatives of “the
boys,” and nothing revealed more clearly how tenderly the thought
of the Province centred about the rows of white tents, where the
flower of its manhood was encamped. By a happy thought the
Camp Commandant, Col. W. E. Thompson, added to the ordinary
review exercises a short march in column of route, so the men
would pass immediately in front of their many friends.</p>

<p>H.R.H. THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT INSPECTING THE HIGHLAND BRIGADE AT ALDERSHOT CAMP, SEPTEMBER, 1916.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>On Saturday morning Field-Marshall His Royal Highness the
Duke of Connaught arrived. Exhilarated by the enthusiasm of the
previous day, the Brigade excelled itself in its manoeuvres, and
especially in the March Past. His Royal Highness, who was too
fine a soldier to be guilty of a meaningless expression, declared that
he had not inspected anything finer in the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other function completes the tale of reviews. It was the
presentation of colors by Lady Borden to the four Battalions on
Monday, September 25th. No little practice was necessary for the
involved movements connected with the ceremony. Once again the
weather was propitious; the sunbeams kissed the silken colors as
they were unfurled to the breeze, and rousing cheers greeted the
declaration of the Premier that they would shortly be sent over the
seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon a competition was commenced between the various
platoons of the Brigade, which resulted in the award going to the
“thirteenth platoon” of the 219th, and as a sign that they had won,
they were permitted to wear their feathers with the edge trimmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday, September 26th, a message arrived ordering the
Brigade to be ready to go Overseas in six days, and cancelling all
leave for officers and men. The announcement of this approaching
embarkation would by itself have been sensational enough, but when
it came accompanied by an order that no one should have the privilege
of seeing his home again, the men were fairly stunned. All
had counted on a “farewell” leave. At first everyone seemed paralyzed.
Then their resolution took shape. It was not in the
Colonel’s power to grant leave but, though a strict disciplinarian, he
understood the situation and felt a deep sympathy for the men, and
determined that his attitude should be as lenient as possible. The
men were resolute to see their homes, many of which were in the
vicinity of the Camp. Every effort was made to stop them.
Cordons with fixed bayonets were placed around the station at
Kentville. But all to no purpose. The majority simply rose and
went. They hired motor cars, mounted horses, or even walked.
For a moment there was a sense of alarm and humiliation, which
quickly changed to confidence and pride as the men came streaming
back, satisfied that they had seen their friends and ready to do their
duty in facing the foe. This unauthorized farewell furlough was
not confined to the 219th but was general in the 185th and the 193rd
as well.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
<img src='images/i_140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The six days’ warning was, of course, a mere preliminary
measure but definite orders at last arrived for the 219th to march
out on the 12th of October at 5 a.m. Never did Halifax seem
lovelier than in the bright autumn air as the Battalion marched
along Barrington Street and up Spring Garden Road and through
South Park Street to the Common, where a vast company of friends
and well-wishers had congregated to say good-bye. Ranks were
broken and the soldiers mingled freely with the people. The “Fall
In” sounded, the band struck up a lively air, and the march was
resumed until the gates of the docks closed behind the last file.
Opportunities of further adieus were granted in the afternoon
within the limit of the dock, and then for the final time the troops
climbed the long gangways to the decks of the transport.</p>

<p class='c007'>All night the <em>Olympic</em> lay at the pier. On Friday afternoon she
moved up to Bedford Basin. Life belts were passed out and
alarms practised. During the afternoon, when rumors that we
were doomed to several days’ detention in the basin were at their
height, the anchor was quietly raised and almost noiselessly the ship
began to glide down the harbor. But the movement was quickly
noticed on shore, and the tooting of tugs and the cheering of the
crowds that rushed to the pier heads showed that the “boys” had
not been forgotten by their friends. The shades of night were
gathering in as Cape Sambro fell astern, and the twinkle of its
kindly light was Nova Scotia’s farewell. Betting in New York
had run as high as twenty to one that the <em>Olympic</em> would be sunk
because the notorious German submarine U53, which had committed
serious depredations off Nantucket, was reported to be in
the vicinity. Whatever anxiety may have been felt by those on the
bridge, seemed not in the slightest degree to have reached the troops
below, who had a confidence in the British seamanship that was
almost sublime.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>On Tuesday night two destroyers picked up the ship and acted
as consorts. Wednesday morning the coast of Ireland was in view,
and Wednesday evening anchor was dropped in the Mersey, the
voyage having been completed in four days and nineteen hours.
We sailed on a Friday, and the thirteenth at that, but war has
exploded the superstitions of the world along with many other
things.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two or three hours were required for the disembarkation.
Eight trains were required for the whole Brigade, and they were
started at various intervals of time. The last two carried the 219th.
It was nearly midnight when the train drew into the siding at
Milford Station and, resuming their packs, the men began their two
miles’ march into Camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Witley Camp was situated on Witley Common, a sandy tract
covered with scattered pines, known as Scotch fir, and with few
houses in the vicinity. Milford Village was a mile and a half away,
and Godalming three miles. The nearest town was Guildford, eight
miles off. The county was Surrey, and the landscape among the
most picturesque in all England.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the first cold snap that greeted the troops on their arrival,
milder conditions prevailed; the air became balmy; the fresh, full
foliage on the trees, and the fragrance of the flowers still in bloom
seemed to carry summer into December. But as November drew
into December cold mists settled into the valley where Witley Camp
lay, and caused an acrid chill that seemed to eat into the marrow of
the bone. Influenza (known as “flu” or “grippe”) invaded the
Camp. The sick parade in the morning increased by leaps and
bounds; the general hospital at Bramshott and the sick detention
hut of the Brigade were filled and could take no more. A special
hut in the Battalion lines was secured and in a few days crowded
out, and even the spare accommodation in the medical room was
covered with bed boards on which lay fevered and coughing men.
December will remain to the troops at Witley Camp something of a
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one as yet seriously believed, or at least publicly announced,
that the Highland Brigade would not be held together. Had not
the Minister of Militia plighted his word to that effect? Had it
not been a promise to the men when they enlisted? Towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>end of November, however, sinister rumors began to filter through
and culminated on the 30th November in the call for the first draft
for France. Immediately the Camp was in a hubbub of excitement,
for the draft required 800 men from the Brigade, and this obviously
meant its dismemberment. All reasonable means that might avert
the blow were employed, but the order was explicit. No officers
were to go except those in charge of drafts, and they were to return
from France whenever their duty was accomplished. All non-commissioned
officers chosen were to revert to the rank of private.
Ultimately 115 went from the 219th under the command of Lieutenant
King. The Brigadier addressed a few parting words, and
to the strains of martial music and the skirl of the pipes the proud
lads marched away leaving a thoughtful Camp behind. What was
to be the fate of those who remained? Rumor again became busy,
hope revived and old predictions were renewed, when once more
with dramatic swiftness the axe fell and when it accomplished its
business the Highland Brigade was no more. No one could have
attempted to parry the blow more resolutely than the Brigadier.
He felt keenly the pledges that had been given and the injustice to
Nova Scotia; and his efforts were not without a measure of success.
Two Battalions of the four were preserved, the 85th and the 185th.
Into the 85th some 350 men, nearly all the Lieutenants and Major
Rudland, were drafted from the 219th. A large number from the
193rd were put into the 185th. The 85th received orders to prepare
at once to go Overseas, though this was not actually accomplished
until February 10th. The 185th was “slated” for the Fifth
Division, and it was to remain in Witley Camp. The remainder of
the Highland Brigade were to proceed to Bramshott Camp. It was
in the last week of December that the large draft, carefully selected
and splendidly fit, changed their feathers from purple to red and
went over to the lines of the 85th. The officers packed their kits
and the happy fellowship of the Mess Room, that had lasted from
the happy days of concentration in sunny Aldershot, was dissolved,
alas, never in its completeness to reassemble again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between five and six hundred of the 219th Battalion still remained.
Kits and trunks were packed, adieus paid, our temporary
English home broken up, and promptly at 12 o’clock Saturday,
December 30th; the Purple Feather ranks, now varied with blue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>green and red feathers, moved off headed by the 85th Band. The
Battalion settled down in a pleasant part of the Bramshott Camp, on
the brow of a hill overlooking the picturesque dale through which
flowed a streamlet gathered from the meadows of Haslemere,
Shottermill and Hammer. It was the country of George Eliot and
of Tennyson’s later years. Many travellers had come to it, but
never any on so strange an errand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently there appeared in Camp the Old 17th. It had been the
first Nova Scotian Unit sent Overseas. Apart from its Commanding
Officer, Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, it possessed hardly any Nova
Scotians; it was officered and its ranks were filled almost exclusively
by Western Canadians. This Battalion, like the famous Minotaur,
had fed on the remnants of many others in its time. Would the
Highland Brigade succumb to the usual fate or would it prove an
indigestible morsel?</p>

<p class='c007'>At the commencement of 1917 a change of policy was inaugurated
affecting all the Canadian Camps in England. Witley was
reserved for the Fifth Division. In the others the Training Brigades
became reserve ones, which would have a full strength of
8,000 each, and each Reserve Battalion (2,000 in strength) would
have some definite fighting Unit at the Front to which it would send
reinforcements whenever required. The 17th was made a Reserve
Battalion in the 5th Reserve Brigade; it was to reinforce the 25th
and 85th and to be distinctively Nova Scotian; it was ordered to
take over the 219th and 193rd. Officially the whale swallowed
Jonah, but in the curious and unscriptural sequel Jonah took over
the control of the whale from the inside. This second transformation
was undoubtedly due to the fact that the 17th Reserve
was to become a Nova Scotian Unit and naturally Nova Scotians
assumed the dominant role; and these were to be found in the ranks
of the Highland Brigade. But it was also due to a stubborn and
persistent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> that had always characterized the 219th.</p>

<p class='c007'>The formal transference took place on January 23rd, and that
date marks the end of the 219th as a distinct military Unit, and
forms a fitting close to this article. It has been the story of a
splendid Battalion into which the Western Counties of Nova Scotia
poured their best manhood with unstinted patriotism. It represents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the finest sacrifice ever made by the loyal enthusiasm of that part
of the Province. Fisherman, farmer, lumberman, student, minister,
lawyer, doctor drilled side by side in a spirit of comradeship seldom
excelled.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not given to this bloodless narrative to trace to the field of
battle the brave men that filled the ranks, but in the tale of their
Battalions they will be found to have played their part in the defence
of civilization bravely and well, and to have left to their country
the legacy of an imperishable example.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 246th Battalion was authorized in August, 1916, as a
Reserve Unit to supply reinforcements to the Nova Scotia
Highland Brigade. It was organized at Camp Aldershot a
short time before the Brigade embarked for Overseas, and to it
were transferred officers and other ranks who, from various causes,
were temporarily unfit for service at the Front. Each Battalion
of the Brigade was represented by one Company, “A” Company,
the 85th Battalion; “B” Company, 185th Battalion; “C” Company,
193rd Battalion, and “D” Company, 219th Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A detachment of the 246th under the command of Major H. D.

<p class='c007'>During the autumn and winter months recruiting became very
difficult, and when the necessity for compulsory service became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>evident it was decided to discontinue organization and send the
Battalion Overseas in drafts. The first draft, under the command
of Lieuts C. E. Baker and W. M. Bligh, embarked in March, 1917,

at Witley with the 5th Division. The remainder together with the

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the strength left in Canada was transferred

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <em>NO. 2 CONSTRUCTION BATTALION.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>No. 2 Construction Battalion was authorized on July 5, 1916.
Mr. D. H. Sutherland, of River John, N.S., a well-known
railroad contractor, who had enlisted in the 193rd Overseas
Battalion, was given command of this Unit with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>An Infantry Battalion was not deemed advisable as the population
was not sufficient to send the
necessary reinforcements; therefore a
Construction Battalion was authorized
to represent the colored citizens of
Canada, who were demanding that their
race should be represented in the C.E.F.
by a Unit composed of their own people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colored citizens of Canada are
settled principally in the Provinces of
Nova Scotia and Ontario, although of
late years a great many have settled in
Western Canada. Out of a total population
in Canada of 20,000, including
men, women and children, Nova Scotia has 7,000; Ontario 5,000;
New Brunswick 1,000, and the remainder of the colored population
are settled in Western Canada. It is estimated that 200 colored men
were engaged in coal mines in Nova Scotia, and therefore not eligible
to enlist. The number of men who enlisted in No. 2 Construction
from Nova Scotia was 500, so that of the men available in Nova
Scotia, the colored citizens sent Overseas in No. 2 Construction
Battalion fully 10 per cent. of their population as volunteers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recruiting was carried on simultaneously wherever the colored
population were located. A detachment of sixty men, under command
of Capt. W. A. McConnell, was raised at Toronto and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>latterly joined the detachment at Windsor, Out., under the command
of Capt. A. J. Gayfer. The Ontario recruits in all numbered
350. About fifty recruits volunteered from Western Canada. The
headquarters was first located at Pictou, N.S., and later transferred
to Truro, where more barracks room was available.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 2 Construction Battalion was the only volunteer Unit to
engage in war-work before proceeding Overseas. A Company of
250 men, under command of Capt. Kenneth A. Morrison, was
employed during the months of January, February and part of
March lifting rails from the Grand Trunk sidings at Moncton,
Nappadogan and Edmundston, N.B., to be shipped Overseas for
the Western Front.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Harry B. McLean, of the Cook Construction Company, and
Wheaton Bros., presented the Unit with a set of band instruments.
Mr. Andrew Wheaton also assisted the Unit financially. Mr.
H. B. McLean was appointed Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel on
account of his interest in and assistance to the Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit embarked at Halifax, March 25, 1917, on board the
troopship <em>Southland</em>; in all there were 3,500 troops on board. The
ship was in command of Captain Morehouse, and the troops in
command of Lieut.-Col. D. H. Sutherland. The convoy arrived
at Liverpool April 8th. During the passage great precautions were
taken to guard against enemy submarines. No lights were shown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>no bugles blown and a constant watch was kept day and night for
floating mines and submarines. This period was the worst in the
history of submarine warfare, as more ships were sunk during the
week April 1 to April 8, 1917, than at any time during the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit entrained at Liverpool Sunday noon, April 8th, and
left for Seaford, travelling by special troop train through a very
picturesque country. Arriving at Seaford the Unit was escorted
by a British band to our Camp under canvas, about two miles from
the depot. All troops arriving from Canada at this time were
segregated ten days, to avoid the introduction of contagious diseases.
The Unit was taken on the strength of the Canadian forces
at Seaford, under command of Col. G. S. Gardiner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before proceeding to France, it was necessary for any Unit to
have the full quota of men in accordance to the establishment of
the Unit. As No. 2 Construction was 300 under strength, the Unit
was reorganized into a Construction Company of 506 men and ten
officers. As there was no provision on the establishment for a
Lieutenant-Colonel, Lieut.-Col. Sutherland, Officer Commanding,
reverted to the rank of Major to proceed to France in command of
the Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at Seaford, from April 8 to May 17, 1917, the Unit
was detailed into working parties and employed in building
trenches for the troops in training and in building and repairing
roads within the bounds of the Canadian command. Permanent
air picket was detailed about May 1st, to be in readiness in the
event of air raids, which were of frequent occurrence. During
the Sports’ Day Competition among the Canadian Forces at Seaford,
the members of No. 2 Construction won a silver cup presented
for competition by the British Y.M.C.A.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was ordered to France on May 17th, and entrained at
Seaford at 2 a.m., May 17th, arriving at Folkestone and proceeding
direct to the Channel troopship at the pier. The crossing occupied
two hours. The Channel boats carrying troops were well escorted
by British destroyers on port and starboard sides, while the <em>Silver
Queen</em>, a small-sized dirigible airship, escorted our troopship overhead
to sight for enemy submarines. Arriving at Boulogne at
3 p.m. the Unit was escorted to a rest camp; twenty-four hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>later, on May 18th, the Unit entrained at Boulogne and travelled
by special troop train by Etaples, Paris, Dijon, Dole, Mouchard
and arrived at our destination, La Joux, Jour Mountains, on May
21st.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was attached to No. 5 District, Canadian Forestry
Corps, under command of Lieut.-Col. Geo. Johnson. There were
four Forestry Companies consisting of 170 men, 40 teams, logging
and sawmill outfit, located within one-half mile radius from No. 2
Construction Company’s Camp. The officers and men of No. 2
Construction were detailed into working parties and paraded daily
to assist in the logging, milling and shipping operations of the
Forestry Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers were employed as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Sutherland was in command of the Unit and kept a
general supervision over the different working parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. J. S. Grant was employed as officer in charge of shipping
for No. 5 District, and all lumber sawn by the four Companies was
shipped at La Joux Station by No. 2 Construction men. A detachment
of fifty men, under command of Lieut. H. Fyles, assisted
No. 22 Company, C.F.C., in logging and in the construction of a
narrow gauge railway to transport saw-logs to the mill. The roads
were kept in repair by Capt. David Anderson, No. 2 Construction,
with a party of 100 men. A road plant consisting of a rock
crusher, steam drill, motor lorries and steam roller, was employed,
and the roads were kept in a good state of repair where the heavy
traffic demanded the best roads possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The water to supply the Camp had to be pumped to an elevation
of 1,500 feet by means of force pumps in relay. Lieut. Bertram
Hayes was officer in charge of pumping stations and water lines.
Capt. R. Livingstone was Transport Officer for No. 5 District,
assisted by Lieut. Russell McLean, both of No. 2 Construction
Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 30, 1917, Capt. K. A. Morrison left La Joux for
Alencon, in command of 180 other ranks to report to the O.C.
No. 1 District, C.F.C.; Lieut. S. Hood was Adjutant of this detachment.
Fifty other ranks were despatched to 37th Company, C.F.C.,
near Peronne.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>A few items, as follows, taken from the War Diary of this Unit
July 1, 1918, will be of interest:</p>

<p class='c007'>Dominion Day celebrated by the eleven Forestry Companies and
No. 2 Construction Company, composing No. 5 District, in field
sports held at Chapois. The four Companies from La Joux,
namely, No. 22, 40, 50 and No. 2 Construction paraded to the
grounds under the command of Major Sutherland. During the
day, the band of this Company, by their excellent music, greatly
assisted in entertaining the crowd and making the holiday a success.</p>

<p class='c007'>July 7, 1918: Camp inspected by Lieut.-General Sir Richard
Turner, V.C., accompanied by Major-General A. MacDougall,
G.O.C. Canadian Forestry Corps, and Lieut.-Colonel Johnson, O.C.
Jura Group. The interior economy and general tidiness were
favorably commented upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>July 13, 1918: Hon. Capt. W. A. White, Chaplain, returns
from visiting the Alencon detachment.</p>

<p class='c007'>July 14, 1918: Sunday, no work. The Mayor of Salins
invited the Canadians in this district to send a detachment to Salins
to take part in a review in which American and French troops
were participating. Major Sutherland represented Lieut.-Col.
G. M. Strong, D.S.O., O.C. No. 5 District, C.F.C., who was absent
on duty, and acted as reviewing officer of the Allied Troops at
Salins, in commemorating the National Day and to do honor to
the French Republic. The band of this Company, under the leadership
of Sergt. G. W. Stewart, played the National Anthem and a
programme and greatly assisted in making the event a memorable
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>July 15, 1918: Camp inspected by General Bouillard, Commanding
7th Army Division, French, and Lieut.-Col. G. Johnson,
O.C. Jura Group.</p>

<p class='c007'>April 3, 1918: The following telegram sent to the D.T.O.,
C.F.C., France, from the O.C. No. 2 Construction Company:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you please recommend my Unit which is organized for
construction work for transfer to Western Front.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1918, Colonel Strong, D.S.O., O.C. No. 5 District,
C.F.C., recommended that No. 2 Construction Company be given
the establishment of a Battalion. This recommendation was approved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>by the G.O.C., General White, and General MacDougall, but held
up for lack of reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the Armistice, orders were received for this Unit
to report at the General Base Depot, Etaples. The Unit left La
Joux, December 4th. One hundred and fifty Russian soldiers, who
had been attached to No. 2 Construction Company during 1918,
were taken over by No. 40 Company, C.F.C. No. 2 Construction
arrived at Etaples December 7th, and was joined by the detachment
from Alencon and fifty men from 37th Company, C.F.C.
The Unit sailed from Boulogne, December 14th, with 600 attached
troops, under command of Major Sutherland, and arrived at Bramshott
Camp. The Unit was attached to the Nova Scotia Regimental
Depot, and from there dispersed to the several military
camps representing the various military districts in Canada, to
which the men would be forwarded for demobilization. The
different drafts composing this Unit sailed the latter part of
January, 1919, for Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>A letter was received by Major Sutherland from Major-General
MacDougall conveying the thanks of the Canadian Forestry Corps
to the officers and men of this Unit for their valuable and faithful
services while attached for duty and discipline, to the Canadian
Forestry Corps.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <em>THE CANADIAN FORESTRY CORPS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>On February 15, 1916, the Colonial Secretary cabled to the
Governor-General of Canada, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught,
the following message:</p>

<p class='c019'>“H.M. Government would be grateful if the Canadian Government
would assist in the production of timber for war purposes. Owing to
the very serious shortage of freight for munitions, food, forage and
other essentials, which is a matter of the gravest concern to H.M.
Government, it is impossible to continue to import Canadian timber on
a sufficiently large scale to meet war requirements, and arrangements
must therefore be made for felling and converting English forests.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Chief difficulty is finding sufficient skilled labor, fellers, haulers
and sawyers. One thousand five hundred men are urgently needed, and
H.M. Government would suggest that a Battalion of lumbermen might
be formed of specially listed men to undertake exploitations of forests
of this country. If proposal commends itself to Canadian Government,
would beg very early action. Suggest that men be enlisted into Canadian
Expeditionary Force and despatched in small companies under
competent supervision. Government is aware that lumber season is now
in progress, but feel sure that men would enlist even at sacrifice of
present employment if the reason of appeal were made known to them.
Incidence of cost will be arranged as agreeable to Canadian Government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A further cable was sent on February 29th. So quickly did the
Canadian authorities make up their minds, that on March 1, 1916,
a cable was sent stating that the Battalion asked for would be provided
with the least possible delay. The raising of Units in this
Corps exemplified the readiness of the Canadian Government to
assist in the most unexpected direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 224th Battalion, under Lieut.-Colonel McDougall, arrived
in England, April 28, 1916, and the 230th, 238th and 242nd Battalions
followed within six months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nova Scotia’s quota in this branch of the Service was about
525 officers and men, known as the Nova Scotia Forestry Draft,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>composed of three Companies with a personnel of officers as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Staff.</em>—Major M. C. Denton, Officer Commanding; Major E. J.
Stehlen, Second in Command; Capt. J. G. Pierce, Adjutant.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“A” Company.</em>—Capt. M. D. McKeigan, O.C.; Lieut. A. Roy,
Lieut. Parker McDonald, Lieut. David Neal.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>“B” Company.</em>—Capt. G. D. Blackader, O.C.; Lieut. N. P.
McKenzie, Lieut. C. B. McDougall, Lieut. C. F. Kinney.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_155.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>MAJOR M. C. DENTON,<br />Forestry Corps.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><em>“C” Company.</em>—Capt. H. B. Verge,
O.C.; Lieut. George Harding, Lieut R. S.
Shreve, Lieut. W. V. R. Winters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Authorization for this Unit was
granted in March, 1917. Recruiting and
organization work began immediately by
Companies, under the direct supervision
of the Company Commanders in the
various counties as follows: “A” Company
in Pictou, Cape Breton, Victoria and
Inverness; “B” Company in Halifax,
Cumberland, Colchester and Prince
Edward Island; and “C” Company in
Shelburne, Queens, Lunenburg, Yarmouth
and Digby; “A” and “B” Companies mobilized at Truro;
“C” Company at Yarmouth; and on May 29th all Companies proceeded
to Aldershot to complete the work of organization, after
which they embarked on the White Star Line Transport <em>Justicia</em>,
and arrived in England, July 4, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Base Depot for the Corps was at Smith’s Lawn, Sunningdale,
Berkshire, within the confines of Windsor Great Park. This
site was given to the Corps by His Majesty the King in December,
1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the middle of August the entire draft was broken up, a
portion of the officers and men were absorbed into other Forestry
Units, operating in England, Scotland and the South of France.
Officers that were not disposed of in this manner transferred to the
Flying Corps, Canadian Railway Troops, Infantry and Labor
Battalions, subsequently getting over to France.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>It is difficult to conceive the multitude of ways in which timber
was used for war purposes. At the Front, the Army very largely
walked on timber, lorries drove on timber, railways, light and
heavy, required huge numbers of sleepers or ties. Underground no
less than above ground was timber used for dugouts, and all the
complicated contrivances connected with trench warfare. From
huts to ammunition boxes, from duckboards to stakes for barbed
wire entanglements, the uses of timber ranged. The general specifications
for a Company’s operation in this Corps was the production
of Sawn Lumber, Fuelwood, Pickets, Hurdles, Fascines,
Faggots, Continuous Rivetting and Parry Sticks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to save time, and for other reasons, it was arranged
that Canadians should bring with them their own machinery and
equipment of the kind to which they were accustomed, with the
necessary modifications to adapt it to the conditions in Britain and
France. The work of the Forestry Corps was thus not only of the
utmost assistance in meeting the need of timber for the War, and
in saving tonnage, but was of permanent value in that it has knit
more closely together the people of Great Britain, with their compatriots
scattered throughout Canada.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <em>NO. 6 DISTRICT DEPOT.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>During the early part of 1918 when the Germans were
making their last great drive, few people realized that preparations
were already made for the demobilization of the
Canadian Corps. These preparations were due to the foresight of
Headquarters Staff. Accordingly when the organization of No. 6
District Depot was completed on the 18th of April, 1918, a District
Depot was established in each Military District of Canada, each
Depot being designated by the number of the Military District in
which the Depot was situated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. B. W. Roscoe, D.S.O., was first appointed Officer
Commanding, and he had under him a small but efficient Staff, with
Capt. J. S. Davies, M.C., as Adjutant, headquarters being at Leith
House, Hollis Street, Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>The functions of District Depots at first were many. Besides
carrying out ordinary discharges, all personnel in the different
hospitals had to be looked after, and in addition to this all casualties
who became fit for further service were allotted to the different
Service Companies and Battalions in the District and to their own
Units Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 6 District Depot differed from the other Depots in so far
that it had an Embarkation Casualty Section which handled all
casualties, on embarkation; that is to say, when troops were proceeding
Overseas from the different districts of Canada, who for
various reasons could not embark at the appointed time, they were
taken on the strength of No. 6 District Depot and forwarded by
some future sailing.</p>

<p class='c007'>This work was carried on by Lieut.-Colonel Roscoe until June,
1918, when Lieut.-Col. D. A. MacRae, 25th Battalion, was appointed
Officer Commanding, with Capt. G. T. Shaw, 31st Battalion,
as Adjutant, headquarters being removed to Wellington Barracks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>From this time on the work began to increase owing to the
great number of men returning from England to be demobilized.
Demobilization went on very rapidly, and when the Armistice
suddenly came it was realized that more speedily to carry out
demobilization No. 6 District Depot would have to be enlarged.
With this in view two Dispersal Stations known as “A” and “B”
were added to the Depot, these Dispersal Stations being situated in
Charlottetown and Halifax, and commanded by Major J. S. Stanley
and Major J. G. Johnstone, respectively. To these officers was
allotted the greater part of the organization of their respective
stations which was carried on in such a manner that great credit
was reflected upon the Depot as well as upon the officers commanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything was now in readiness to handle very speedily troops
arriving for demobilization, so that when the first complete Unit,
the Royal Canadian Regiment, arrived at the Port of Halifax
early in March, 1919, it was demobilized in less than a day. This
was made possible by the hard work of the Officer Commanding
Dispersal Station B, Major J. G. Johnstone.</p>

<p class='c007'>This work was kept up by the stations throughout Canada until
late in July, 1919, when it was found that the Canadian Corps had
practically been demobilized. At first it was thought it would take
two years to complete demobilization of our forces, but the whole
work was carried on so speedily that the feat was practically
accomplished in six months. This in itself speaks well of the
splendid organization of the Depots.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 6 Depot, besides demobilizing the Maritime troops, demobilized
a great number of troops from other districts, viz., the
Cavalry Brigade, Engineer and Forestry Units, Railway Troops
and several Hospital Units. The work of No. 6 Depot was highly
praised by Gen. John Hughes during his tour of inspection, when
he stated that No. 6 District was one of the best organized throughout
Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>One will realize the immense amount of work done by No. 6
District Depot by the results obtained; that is to say, the total
number of discharges from April 18, 1918, until the latter part of
May 1920, were one thousand five hundred and seventy-eighty
(1,578) officers and twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>ninety-six other ranks (27,896), made up as shown in the table

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <em>THE ARMY SERVICE CORPS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In the lexicon of the Army Service Corps, the word “impossible”
does not exist. It was this spirit, insistently inculcated
since the organization of the Corps in 1902, that made the
accomplishment of the seemingly “impossible” possible by the
Canadian Army Service Corps in the Maritime Provinces when
the Kaiser let roar his terrorizing thunderbolts in August, 1914.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_161.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. E. C. DEAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Blatant glory has seldom perched on
the escutcheon of this hard-worked Corps,
but, on the other hand, the capable work
of the Army Service Corps has frequently
been the means of attracting this coy bird
to a resting place on the banner of many
a Unit whose prowess fills the pages of
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Briefly, it is the efficient service of the
Army Service Corps that makes possible
the achievement of great things by the
army.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to record the history
of the Canadian Army Service Corps in the Maritime Provinces
throughout the duration of the Great War—and after—without beginning
at the basis of the structure, namely, No. 4 Detachment of
the Canadian Permanent Army Service Corps, now known as No. 6
Detachment of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, having its
headquarters at Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 4, 1914, No. 4 Detachment was officered by five
officers of the Canadian Permanent Army Service Corps, two
attached officers of the Active Militia, and one officer of the Imperial
Army Service Corps, attached. The Detachment was administered
by Major E. C. Dean, who was attached to the Staff of Military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>District No. 6 as an Assistant Director of Supplies and Transport
(now Lieut.-Colonel E. C. Dean, Senior Supply and Transport
Officer, attached to the Staff of M.D. No. 6). He was also Commandant
of the Canadian Army Service Corps School of Training.
In command of the Detachment was Major R. O. Marks, an officer
of the Imperial Army Service Corps, temporarily loaned to the
Canadian Sister Corps. He was also Adjutant of the School of
Training. The other officers of the Permanent Force were Lieut.
H. O. Lawson (now Major Lawson, Senior Supply and Transport
Officer, M.D. No. 3, Kingston, Ontario); Lieut. Keith MacDougall
(now Major MacDougall, in charge of No. 6 Detachment,
R.C.A.S.C.); Lieut. J. A. Gwynne (who proceeded Overseas as
Adjutant of the Second Divisional Train); and Lieut., now Capt.,
George Simms, District Barracks Officer—a most efficient, hard-working
officer, whose capability went a long way towards making
possible the quartering and comfort of many thousands of troops
in the Maritime Provinces. The splendid services rendered by this
officer—his absolute devotion to his arduous duties, his zeal and
tireless efforts in behalf of the C.E.F., and, at the same time, his
careful supervision of all matters pertaining to the financial interests
of the public purse—are well worthy of recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two attached officers of the Active Militia were Lieut. (now
Major) H. R. Hendy, of Esquimalt, B.C., and Capt. H. J. B.
Keating, of No. 6 Company, Canadian Army Service Corps.
Captain Keating is now stationed at Quebec.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rank and file of the Detachment numbered less than fifty—scarcely
sufficient to care for the needs of Halifax Garrison in peace
time. The available transport comprised about a half-dozen horses,
two time-worn Ford passenger cars, two steamboats, and a “dumb”
lighter. Practically the whole of the land transport was carried out
by horses and wagons under a civilian contractor—Mr. George E.
VanBuskirk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Supply Depot, including grocery store, bakery, and meat
shop, was located within the confines of Glacis Barracks—the
headquarters of the Army Service Corps at Halifax—in a small
brick building which, under the regime of the Imperials, had been
used as a school for the senior children of Imperial soldiers in garrison
at Halifax. Under peace conditions this building was inadequate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>for the purposes for which it was used, and, needless to say, under
war demands its continuance as such was out of the question. All
flour, bread, groceries, meat, and other supplies, had to be taken in
and out of one small door.</p>

<p class='c007'>To meet war requirements, the garrison gymnasium—situated
about fifty feet from the old senior school building—was taken over
and converted into an ideal Supply Depot. The former grocery store
was then opened up to enlarge the bakery, which was modernized
by the introduction of electrically-operated machinery and new and
enlarged ovens. The meat shop was also improved, the chill room
enlarged and modernized by the addition of a “trolley” system for
the expeditious handling of meat. Thus in a short time the handicap
with which the Army Service Corps labored at the outbreak of
war was quickly overcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most serious difficulty, however, which had to be combatted
was that of obtaining sufficient men to carry out the increased work
thrown upon this Corps by the sudden strengthening of Halifax
Garrison, and the calling out of troops to guard various points in
the Maritime Provinces. This was a real and trying hardship.
The other Permanent Force Units forming Halifax Garrison could
not spare men to assist the Army Service Corps, as every man was
needed within his own Unit. The problem was partly solved by
calling up a number of non-commissioned officers and men of No. 8
Company, Canadian Army Service Corps, commanded by Capt.
F. W. Wickwire, with headquarters at Kentville, N.S. No. 7 Company,
commanded by Major A. L. Massie, with headquarters at
St. John, also supplied a few. Later on Lieut.-Col. I. W. Videto,
commanding the 63rd Halifax Rifles, and Lieut.-Col. A. King, commanding
the 66th Princess Louise Fusiliers, very generously loaned
a number of splendid men, whose ready adaptability made it possible
for the Army Service Corps to “carry on.” As time advanced
enlistments made the Corps more or less self-sustaining, but the
fact remains that never throughout the duration of the War were
sufficient men actually enlisted in this branch of the Service to
render it independent of other Units. This condition was probably
due to the fact that the possibility of getting Overseas was greater
by enlisting in other Units.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Mention has been made of Nos. 7 and 8 Companies of the
Canadian Army Service Corps. Both these Companies played
important parts in the Great World War, at home and abroad.
Major Massie took Overseas the Second Divisional Train, and all
the officers and practically the whole of the rank and file of No. 7
Company accompanied him. Captain Wickwire, of No. 8 Company,
after a short period as Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and
Transport, M.D. No. 6, also went over to France with this Train,
and rendered very efficient service with it in the fighting zone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strengthening of the Garrison of Halifax made possible the
fulfilment of the plans of defence, which had long since been carefully
laid down. This, and the summoning of troops for guard
purposes at various points in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
threw a vast amount of work on the Army Service Corps, for not
only had these troops, scattered over a wide area throughout the
three Provinces, to be housed, and their daily wants in the matter
of food, water, light, fuel, straw for bedding, transport and necessary
services arranged for, but it was also required, following a preconceived
plan, to provide for them against the possibility of their being
cut off from their source of supply. To do justice to the amount of
labor involved in the organization and administration of this task
would require a volume greater in size than this one, so all that
can be done is to give a brief outline of the general scheme followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Royal Canadian Regiment, with its supporting
artillery, were ordered to garrison points in the Island of Cape
Breton and Canso, they left Halifax self-sustaining for fourteen
days; that is, they carried with them reserve rations sufficient for
fourteen days for all ranks. In addition they carried rations for
current consumption sufficient for all ranks for a further fourteen
days, but minus meat, butter and bread. Lieut. J. A. Gwynne, of
the Army Service Corps, and one clerk, accompanied the Regiment
to Sydney to make necessary supply and other arrangements. The
tasks this officer had to attend to may be judged when it is known
that he had to make contracts, and to arrange to supply the wants
of troops located at nine different points, covering a frontage of
about fifty miles, and requiring travel by train, steamship, street car
and automobile to reach the various posts. So capably was the duty
performed that the troops had never to go without a meal, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>rations being arranged with practically the regularity which prevailed
in Halifax under peace conditions. When Lieutenant
Gwynne was summoned for service Overseas, he was replaced at
Sydney by Lieut. Horace Westmoreland. Later on this officer went
to France as Transport Officer of the Royal Canadian Regiment,
being replaced at Sydney by Lieut. Cecil Sircom. These three
officers belonged to the Permanent Force, and received their training
at Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the Supply and Transport Officer at Sydney found it impossible
to give any attention to the troops stationed at Canso, the
work there incidental to the Army Service Corps was performed by
the Officer Commanding the Guard, who received the necessary
instructions by telegram and telephone from the Assistant Director
of Supplies and Transport at Halifax, an Army Service Corps’
Clerk being sent to Canso to attend to the necessary accounting.</p>

<p class='c007'>An incident might here be related as exemplifying the difficulties
that had to be overcome from time to time by the Army Service
Corps. Certain heavy guns had to be transported from Prince
Edward Island to points in Nova Scotia. Every effort was put
forth to obtain the services of a ship capable of carrying these guns,
but without success. Finally, after a delay of several days, Lieut.-Colonel
Arthur Peake telephoned from Charlottetown to Halifax
to say that a ship was then approaching Charlottetown Harbor
which might be suitable. The A.D. of S. &amp; T. at Halifax instructed
him to approach the captain of this vessel and explain to him the
situation, and if he was not agreeable to undertaking the task of
transporting these guns, Colonel Peake was to commandeer the ship
and move the artillery to the places directed. Whether it was
Colonel Peake’s persuasiveness or his war-like demeanor that had
the desired effect cannot be stated with certainty. Time was spent
only in removing sufficient of the ship’s cargo to make it possible to
load the guns, which were then transported with despatch. Meanwhile
other arrangements had been made by the Army Service Corps
to carry these guns to the points in Nova Scotia where they were
required.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops forming the actual defence force of Halifax and
environments were supplied on the same basis as those sent to Cape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Breton, so that in the event of necessity they could sustain themselves
for fourteen days, and by the addition of tinned meat and
biscuit, the period could be extended another fourteen days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile troops had been summoned for the defence of St.
John, N.B., which necessitated calling out a portion of No. 7 Company
of the Canadian Army Service Corps, under the command of
Major A. L. Massie. This detachment took up its headquarters in
the Armories, and from there efficiently ministered to the wants of
the troops on duty and in training at St. John and adjoining points.
Lieut. J. Key, who had been trained at Halifax, was sent to St. John
to take up the duties as District Barrack Officer, carrying out these
duties very satisfactorily. Lieut. Arthur Biggar, who was also
trained at Halifax, was despatched to St. John as Officer in Charge
of Supplies, a position he filled very creditably until called for duty
in France. The troops doing duty at St. John and adjacent points
were also rationed on the same basis as were those on duty at
Halifax, Cape Breton, and other points.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that early in the War a Capt. Von
Weghorn, an officer of the Prussian Army, startled the civilized
world by an attempt to destroy the International railway bridge
spanning the St. Lacroix River, between McAdam Junction, on the
Canadian side, and Vanceboro, on the United States’ side. A suitcase
filled with dynamite was placed between the piers of the northeast
corner of the bridge on the Canadian side. The attempt
failed, the bridge being only slightly damaged and traffic not
delayed. It was considered expedient, however, to place an armed
guard on this bridge on the Canadian side. To Lieut.-Col. E. C.
Dean, A.D. of S. &amp; T., M.D. No. 6, fell the duty of making the
necessary supply and other arrangements for this guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar guard was placed over the new railway bridge spanning
the St. John River at St. Leonards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Guards were also established over the Marconi Wireless Towers
at Newcastle, N.B., and Barrington Passage, the latter under command
of Lieut.-Col. T. M. Seeley. These guards required the usual
attention on the part of the Army Service Corps. To maintain the
guard at Barrington Passage was a cause of anxiety, as it was stationed
at a point some miles off the main road, in the midst of a
wilderness, and could be reached only in good weather, as the road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>leading to the Wireless Station from the main highway was-well,
simply impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Permanent guards were also maintained at Louisburg, Glace
Bay, Whitney Pier, Sydney, North Sydney, Sydney Mines, Cranberry
Head, Chapel Hill, Canso and various other places.</p>

<p class='c007'>Incidentally troops were gathering at Valcartier to form the
First Contingent and the quota from the Maritime Provinces had to
be transported to the place of rendezvous. The manner of the
arrangement of this transportation was unique. Recruiting was
being carried on in practically every city, town, village and hamlet
in the Maritime Provinces. Movements were made when it was
known that sufficient numbers of men had been recruited to justify
sending them forward. On the A.D. of S. and T. rested the task
of making train arrangements to get these recruits to Valcartier.
It was done in this manner: Instructions were sent to various
recruiting centres to have certain numbers of recruits entrain on a
certain train on a certain day. Thus, for instance, the first lot
might entrain at Louisburg, and others along the line as far as
Sydney; probably some would be brought over from Sydney Mines
and North Sydney to Sydney. At the latter place two, three or
four special coaches would be attached to a regular train, and as
this train proceeded towards Truro, the number of recruits would
be augmented, until on its arrival at Truro it might have from two
to three hundred on board. Meanwhile, a sufficient number would
be run up from Halifax, and a special train would then be made up at
Truro and run to Levis, P.Q., where a transfer would be made for
Quebec and Valcartier. At other times Moncton would be made
the point at which a special train would be made up, in which case
St. John supplied the completing quota to make up the train load of
500 or thereabouts. It must be borne in mind, however, that the
whole movement was planned ahead of time, and the transport
scheme carried out on a definite plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Obviously it was impossible to send out transport warrants to
cover the movement of these various groups, so an arrangement was
made whereby the railway authorities agreed to accept temporary
interim receipts from officers or non-commissioned officers in
charge of these groups, on the presentation of a telegram or letter
of instruction from either the A.D. of S. &amp; T. or any other Staff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>officer. These receipts were issued in duplicate, one copy of which
was kept by the ticket agent and the other mailed to the A.D. of
S. &amp; T. Upon receipt of the latter, covering transport warrants
were mailed to the ticket agents concerned. By this means some
thousands of troops were moved expeditiously from the Maritime
Provinces to Valcartier.</p>

<p class='c007'>New Units of the Canadian Expeditionary Force were forming
in various parts of the Maritime Provinces, and it behooved the
Army Service Corps to quarter them, arrange for supplies, water,
light, land transportation, barrack equipment, and a thousand and
one details incidental to the requirements of newly-formed military
organizations, and of which only a trained soldier has the faintest
conception. These new Units, or in some cases reinforcements,
were scattered throughout the length and breadth of the three
Provinces, at such places in Nova Scotia as: Halifax, Windsor,
Truro, Pictou, New Glasgow, Antigonish, Sydney, North Sydney,
Sydney Mines, Broughton, Glace Bay and Amherst.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Malleable Iron Works at Amherst, were converted
into a domicile for the involuntary reception and entertainment of
adherents of the doctrines of the Kaiser and his admirers, a small
detachment of the Army Service Corps was sent there to attend to
their well-being. The late Capt. P. F. Keating was in command of
this detachment which had also to look after the needs of the
recruits quartered in Amherst. Captain Keating was trained at
Halifax and later proceeded Overseas in command of No. 4 Company
of the Third Divisional Train. This Company was recruited at
Halifax, having its headquarters in the old Medical College Building
at the corner of College and Carlton Streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the outbreak of war, Canadian horses began to
find their way Overseas. In the first winter of the War the number
shipped from the Port of Halifax was something like 17,000. On
the Army Service Corps rested the duty of embarking these animals.
The absence of forewarning of train loads of horses being en route
for Halifax was sometimes the cause of great anxiety. At five
o’clock one Easter Sunday morning a telephone message from a
railway official conveyed the tidings that there were three train
loads of horses in the freight yards consigned to the Assistant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Director of Supplies and Transport. As this was the first intimation
received of the movement of these horses, naturally no
arrangements had been made for their reception, and as the ships
by which they were to be conveyed Overseas were not in the
harbor, it became necessary to arrange for their disentrainment
without loss of time. Mr. M. McF. Hall, Secretary of the Halifax
Exhibition, was called out of bed by telephone, the situation explained
to him, and arrangements completed to detrain and stable
the horses at the Exhibition Grounds. Every available man of the
Army Service Corps was aroused from bed and marched to the
Exhibition Grounds, there to care for these horses instead of proceeding
to church to take part in Easter Sunday Service. Later, a
detachment of artillerymen was told off to take on the responsibility
of these horses. At least on two other occasions consignments
of horses reached Halifax under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another “job” of the Army Service Corps at Halifax was to
receive, account for and send forward Overseas thousands upon
thousands of parcels of “comforts” for the troops at the Front,
these parcels coming from all parts of Canada, comprising everything
in size from an envelope containing a handkerchief to packing
cases and barrels of comforts of every description. Every parcel
received was given a number, registered, and then despatched
Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrangements for the embarkation of complete Units and reinforcements
of troops during the early part of the War also fell to
the lot of the Army Service Corps, the A.D. of S. &amp; T. being the
responsible officer. He had a most capable and efficient assistant in
the person of Capt. S. A. Doane, of Army Service Corps, whose
knowledge of steamship matters is unsurpassed, and who carried
out practically all the details incidental to the embarkation of troops
at Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Barrack Services under Capt. George Simms was a hard-worked
branch, the pressure on which did not cease until long after
peace had been declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is worthy of mention that throughout the War thousands of
contracts for supplies were made and carried out by the Army
Service Corps in the Maritime Provinces, involving the expenditure
of millions of dollars, the accounting for which was also one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>many duties of the Army Service Corps, yet not in a single instance
was there the breath of scandal discernible, a single transaction
questioned, or a suggestion of deviation from the ethical pathway
of rectitude. Truly a glorious record and heritage for the Canadian
Army Service Corps in the Maritime Provinces, with headquarters
in the Metropolis of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statement has been made that at the outbreak of the Great
World War there were stationed at Halifax eight officers of the
Army Service Corps. Most of these were soon cleared out and
proceeded Overseas. Major Marks, Lieutenants Lawson and
MacDougall were summoned to Valcartier and accompanied the
First Contingent. Lieut.-Colonel Dean was called to take command
of the First Divisional Train, but as his services at Halifax
could not then be spared, he was not permitted to go. Later on he
was given the command of the Second Divisional Train, but again
he was held back, Major A. L. Massie of St. John being given the
command. Col. W. A. Simson, a Nova Scotian, was placed in
command of the First Divisional Train, which proved to be the
“first” Train in more senses than one, inasmuch as it was conceded
to be the best Train in France, barring none.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the establishment of an Army Service Corps Training School
at Toronto, Capt. H. R. Hendy, of Halifax, was appointed Adjutant.
On proceeding Overseas, he was replaced by Capt. Cecil R. Sircom.
Both of these officers received their training at Halifax, as did also
upwards of one hundred officers, all of whom “made good” in
Flanders Fields, bringing credit to themselves, the Army Service
Corps and the Metropolis of Nova Scotia, where they were trained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Nova Scotia officers of the Army Service Corps who
were trained at Halifax and saw service at the Front were: Capt.
G. A. Redford, of New Glasgow; Lieut. D. A. Starr, of Halifax;
Capt. “Ted” Foster, of Bedford; Capt. G. W. Underwood, of New
Glasgow; Capt. Walter Taylor, of Halifax, who transferred his
affections to the Army Medical Corps; Lieut. Frank S. Brennan, of
Halifax, later transferred to the Flying Corps; Lieut. A. B. Dewberry,
of Halifax. In addition Lieut. L. Pierce, of No. 8 Company,
saw service in France, while Lieuts. J. A. Rose, G. H.
Applegate, W. J. V. Tweedie, H. S. Crowe and F. D. Doyle, also
of No. 8 Company, all Nova Scotians, performed meritorious service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>in Canada. Lieut. J. G. Ryan, of Kentville, received his training
at Halifax and filled many important appointments at Sydney,
Amherst, Aldershot, Ottawa and elsewhere. Physical unfitness
rendered him unable to partake in the campaign Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Headquarters Company of the Fourth Divisional Train was
organized at Halifax, the 200 members being recruited almost
entirely from Nova Scotia. The Train was mobilized and trained
at Halifax. It was commanded by Lieut.-Col. E. C. Dean, who took
it Overseas. Of this Unit a Canadian officer in high position in
England said it was one of the best trained bodies of men that
Canada had contributed to the Great War.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the departure Overseas of Lieut.-Colonel Dean, the duties of
A.D. of S. &amp; T. were taken over by Major A. P. Lomas, of No. 6
Company of the Army Service Corps. This officer very efficiently
administered the Army Service Corps affairs in the Maritime Provinces
for nearly three years, and rendered the British Empire
invaluable service. He was ably seconded by Major E. E. Wood,
who commanded the local C.P.A.S.C., now developed into a Company
of upwards of 200 men, having about fifty horses and forty
motor vehicles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Permanent Detachment of the Army Service Corps at
Halifax contributed very materially in personnel to the various
Army Service Corps Units proceeding Overseas, the Detachment
being made up largely of Nova Scotians. The training and disciplining
these men received at Halifax had the effect of leavening
the Overseas Units with which they became associated.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the casualties began to return from France, they came in
ship loads, about ninety per cent. returning through the Port of
Halifax. Sometimes as many as three vessels a week arrived.
Most of the well-known big ships were engaged in bringing home
these war-scarred veterans, among the number being the <em>Olympic</em>,
<em>Aquitania</em> and <em>Mauretania</em>. In this work the Army Service Corps
played an important part, as they made all train, berthing and
feeding arrangements, as well as issuing all ranks with the necessary
tickets for transportation. The Army Service Corps worked out
each train “consist,” gave the completed train schedules to the railroad
officials, who made up the trains in accordance therewith.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Lieut.-Col. E. C. Dean, who had just returned from France, was
appointed Chief Transport Officer. Other Army Service Corps
officers employed on this important work were: Major F. W.
Wickwire (who later succeeded Colonel Dean as Chief Transport
Officer), Capt. S. A. Doane, Lieut. Ken. Love, Capt. L. Prickler,
and Lieut. George H. Edgar. Also assisting were eighty train
conducting officers, one of whom was placed in charge of each troop
train to look after the comforts of the men, see that they were
properly fed, and that the train was run through to its destination
without undue delay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Troops were disembarked at the rate of 1,000 under one hour:
the <em>Olympic</em> and <em>Aquitania</em>, each carrying 5,500, were cleared in
five hours. About twelve to fourteen trains on an average were
required to despatch this number of men homeward, and the fact
that over a quarter of a million men were thus entrained, ticketed,
berthed and fed en route without a single mishap or complaint
serves to illustrate the almost perfect system that prevailed. Troops
were entrained at the rate of 1,000 an hour, which meant that a
troop train departed every half hour, which may be considered
quick work even from a railroad standpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though he was not connected with the military in any way,
at the same time a word of praise is due Mr. Ernie Cameron, now
Superintendent of the Dining and Sleeping Car Department of the
Canadian National Railways at Halifax, for the very able, efficient
co-operation he gave the military authorities in making up trains,
providing most excellent meals for the men en route and in many
ways doing his bit to make the home-coming of the warriors a
happy one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Maritime Provinces, and Nova Scotia in particular, may
justly be proud of the part played in the Great War by their sons
who wore the badges of the Army Service Corps. The highly
creditable achievements of this organization—a Unit usually little
heard of, but which accomplishes big things—has shed lustre on
the names of the three Provinces down by the sounding sea.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <em>THE CANADIAN ORDNANCE CORPS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>On the outbreak of hostilities the Canadian Ordnance Corps
had a strength of four officers, fifty-five other ranks and
thirteen civilians. It was very soon apparent that the
Ordnance Depot would have to be kept working twenty-four hours
per diem. All ranks therefore were immediately placed under
canvas within the Depot, and shifts arranged so that work of the
Ordnance Depot could be continued the whole period of twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The armament of the Fortress and the Royal Canadian
Engineer Defence electric lights were immediately equipped up to
war scale. All fighting equipment necessary for the Royal Canadian
Regiment, the 63rd and 66th Regiments, and 1st Regiment
Canadian Garrison Artillery was immediately issued. Companies
of the 94th and 78th Regiments were later clothed and equipped for
duty at various strategic points in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the manning of all Forts it became necessary to place a
highly trained mechanic, known as an Armament Artificer, in each,
to keep all guns and machinery in repair, and ready for immediate
action. These were provided by the Canadian Ordnance Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the Camp opened at Valcartier, it fell to the lot of
the Canadian Ordnance Corps at Halifax to ship forward the bulk
of the stores for equipping the Units being mobilized at Valcartier.
Day after day, night after night, it was one continuous loading of
cars to rush forward to Valcartier Camp. Special efforts were
made to complete the 17th Battery, C.F.A., Sydney, with clothing
and equipment before proceeding to Valcartier.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prior to the departure of the 1st Division from Valcartier, an
advance party from the Canadian Ordnance Corps was being sent
to England to prepare for the arrival of the Canadians in England.
Conductor J. D. Pitman and three non-commissioned officers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>men left Halifax with seventy minutes notice and proceeded to
England as part of the Canadian Ordnance Corps advance party.
The party were each in possession of a haversack and water bottle
as their kit. Conductor Pitman received promotion to the rank
of Major, and held Staff appointments on the various Divisions in
France, finally being made Chief Ordnance Officer, Canadian Overseas
Military Forces, and was awarded the D.S.O.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the Imperial Government was, during the early stage of the
War, urgently in need of guns and ammunition, all guns and ammunition
which could be spared from this district were immediately
shipped away direct to the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two Armament Artificers also left Halifax to proceed with the
Canadian Artillery Brigades of the 1st Division, and of these two,
Armament Q.M.S. Smith, it is regretted, after having greatly
distinguished himself in action, died of the result of wounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1915, the Halifax Detachment of the Canadian
Ordnance Corps sent Overseas a nucleus of an Ordnance Mobile
Workshop required by the Canadian Corps for the inspection,
repair and upkeep of guns and vehicles of all kinds in the Field.
This Unit was placed under the command of Major A. S.
Buttenshaw, Inspector of Ordnance Machinery. This officer was
afterwards Chief Inspector of Ordnance Machinery, Canadian
Forces, and was awarded the D.S.O. Other ranks of the Detachment
were moved away from time to time Overseas as ordered from
Ottawa. Owing to the enormous amount of work required in the
clothing and equipping of C.E.F. Units in the district, it was
necessary to more than treble the Staff, recruits enlisting being
trained for their duties by the few permanent men who, though
much against their own wishes, were kept in Halifax, and even
then all ranks were working day and night. The explosion which
occurred in Halifax, December, 1917, also added to the work,
various temporary hospitals being equipped by the Canadian
Ordnance Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August, 1918, one officer and nine other ranks of the Halifax
Detachment, C.O.C., were ordered to Vancouver as part of the
Siberian Expeditionary Force. Several cars were loaded at Halifax
with stores for this force and sent forward. The Halifax Detachment,
with Ordnance men from other districts, arrived in Russia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>at Vladivostock and at once opened up a complete Ordnance Depot,
where work was carried on in the usual smooth manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several hundred thousand tons of ammunition, arms, equipment
and clothing have been handled by the Canadian Ordnance Corps
at Halifax during the period of the War, both coming from and
going to England. The Ordnance Workshops at Halifax carried
out an enormous amount of repair work, and in addition manufactured
large quantities of military stores which were unable to
be purchased. Tradesmen enlisting in the C.E.F. in various parts
of Canada, such as wheelers, blacksmiths, saddlers and armorers,
who were required to accompany troops Overseas, were sent to the
Canadian Ordnance Corps, Halifax, for training. The Ordnance
Department was also called upon to carry out all repairs and testing
of ammunition for the Naval Services, both Imperial and Canadian,
in addition to that of the Land Service. This work has to be done
by experts, and necessitates very long hours, as certain cordite
tests have to run continually day and night for several days at a
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the War, all the equipment, including ammunition, for the
new Reorganized Active Militia, is being handled at Halifax and
reshipped to the various military points in Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following officers and senior warrant officers of Canadian
Ordnance Corps have served with No. 6 Detachment, Canadian
Ordnance Corps, during various periods of the War:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel J. F. MacDonald; Lieut.-Colonels A. H. Panet and
M. C. Gillin; Majors A. S. Buttenshaw, D.S.O., and J. D. Pitman,
D.S.O.; Captains E. M. Cartmer, J. H. MacQueen, S. V. Cooke,
A. M. Simons, J. N. Gibson, and R. N. C. Bishop; Lieut. G. E. J.
Ball; Conductors J. A. Villard, E. V. Hessian, A. Bentley, D.C.M.,
and A. Lable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In recognition of services rendered during War 1914–1918, His
Majesty the King has graciously approved the grant of the title
“Royal” to the Canadian Permanent Ordnance Corps, and hereafter
this Corps is permitted to bear the designation of “The Royal
Canadian Ordnance Corps.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The medical men of this Province were no less ardent in their
desire to serve their country in the War than all the other
professions, trades and callings. It was a contagion in the
air that got into the blood. Sooner or later everybody got it and
responded to it according to their own notion of service or opportunity.
Medical men were needed at home as well as abroad. There
were recruits to be examined and young soldiers in training requiring
medical and surgical attention and the country could not be
stripped of medical service. No sooner were Units formed than
there was a clamor for medical appointments. Some medical men
even joined the combatant ranks, although they were soon returned
to the medical service owing to the demand for medical officers.
Also many Nova Scotia medical men went direct to England, or were
already abroad, and joined up with the Royal Army Medical Corps.
Many of these, with many regimental medical officers, owing to
their isolation from the great body of medical men associated with
Canadian Hospitals, will be overlooked in narratives of the doings
of the medical fraternity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before describing in detail the medical work done by Nova
Scotians during the War, it will be useful to give a brief outline of
the activities of the Medical Service in war.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Medical attention is required all the way from the recruiting
and training camps at home, and those in England and France and
along the lines of communication, up to the front areas and fighting
Units in the firing line, No Man’s Land and the hand-to-hand
encounter in the enemy trenches. But perhaps the function of the
Medical Service which calls for the greatest vigilance and most
thorough care is the prevention and control of epidemic and contagious
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most strenuous efforts of the Medical Services are exerted
to rescue the man who is wounded in action, and to give him such
prompt attention as will prevent him, as far as possible, from
bleeding to death or dying from shock or exposure and to hasten
him to a place where the best surgical skill can be exercised to save
his life and limbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The primary aid is under the direction of the Regimental
Medical Officer who is assisted by sixteen stretcher-bearers and two
orderlies whom it is his duty to keep in a constant state of efficiency
by careful training, as unskilled men, during active operations, are
constantly being added from the ranks to make up wastage. One
Nova Scotia Regiment lost thirty-three per cent. of its stretcher-bearers
in two hours in the Vimy Ridge engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>This little coterie goes into the trenches with the Unit. The
Regimental Medical Officer selects a Regimental Aid Post (R.A.P.)
well to the front and as far as possible out of the direct line of
enemy fire, so that the wounded may be safely cared for and
promptly evacuated. The stretcher-bearers are detailed four to
each Company, and these go with their Companies into action and
accompany them wherever they go. They are the most exposed
men in an engagement; for while the combatants may advance in
rushes and seek shelter as they go, the stretcher-bearer is constantly
exposed, going back and forth to the relief of the wounded.
As a result of the efficiency these men attain, their dressings,
applied on the battle-field during action, often can go untouched
until they reach the hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Regimental Aid Post further treatment is given by the
Regimental Medical Officer, food and hot tea or coffee are given
and the wounded are rolled in blankets and made as comfortable
as possible before being sent out. All cases are tagged, usually a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>white tag showing the man’s name, number, Regiment, the nature of
his injury, and any special treatment or remedies that may have
been given. In dangerous cases a red tag is used, which secures
the right of way in rapid evacuation and immediate attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as casualties are ready for evacuation from the R.A.P.
they are handed over to the Bearer Section of a Field Ambulance
to be carried to their Advanced Dressing Station. As it is practically
never possible to establish the Main Dressing Station sufficiently
far forward to convey stretcher cases to it in one relay, and
at the same time have it accessible to motor ambulances, light
railways and other means of rapid evacuation, Advanced Dressing
Stations are set up as near the front as can be evacuated to the
Main Dressing Station by horsed ambulances with reasonable safety
by day as well as by night. The evacuation of the wounded up to
this point must usually be done at night on account of enemy
observation; though the walking wounded are often able to take
advantage of lulls in the hostile fire and make their way out during
the day. Usually arrows are put up along the route pointing the
direction for “walking wounded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Main Dressing Station of the Field Ambulance is provided
with facilities for attending to cases requiring immediate operation
as the only means of saving life. It must be remembered that this
Unit is on the field of actual operations and within reach of the
direct fire of the enemy. The sick and wounded are here sorted,
classified and evacuated as soon as possible to the Casualty Clearing
Station (C.C.S.). The few mild cases that can be returned to the
line or sent to near-by rest camps after twenty-four or forty-eight
hours are held at the Field Ambulance, it being necessary to conserve,
as much as possible, the man-power for the line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Casualty Clearing Station affords the next relief. This is
the first Unit completely equipped for urgent, formal major operations,
and some have X-ray apparatus and electrically-heated
operating tables. Although cases are not carried to a finality of
treatment, and are only kept until fit to move after relief is given,
practically all wounds are dressed at the C.C.S. After emergent
operations wounds are often packed with dressings and hurried on
to a general hospital in the Lines of Communication. It must be
remembered that these Units are within range of enemy guns and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>liable to get short notice from the enemy, by concentrated high
explosive shell-fire, to vacate, or they may have to advance with
the advance of their own troops. Constant action is therefore
necessary to maintain rooms for the steady stream of wounded
which they must always be prepared to handle. It is only the most
urgent operations that are performed, such as wounds of the
abdomen, chest and brain, or such wounds as are liable to become
hopeless through infection or complications before reaching the
base. The C.C.S. is usually located at a rail head and has access to
ambulance trains for evacuation. These trains are wonderfully
equipped with an emergency operating room, kitchen, dining room
for up-patients and Staff sleeping berths, dispensary, medical
officers, nurses and orderlies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now comes the first real hospital treatment. All along the
coast of France and at suitable places were hospital centres such as
Calais, St. Omer, Le Treport, Le Havre, Rouen, Etaples and
Boulogne, with General and Stationary and Special Hospitals.
These centres were under an A.D.M.S., who was informed usually
twice daily by the different hospitals what empty beds were available.
From this information convoys (hospital trains) were
dispatched from the C.C.S. to the different hospitals. These were
notified by telegraph of the approximate time of arrival so that
ample provision could be made to transfer by motor ambulance the
patients from the train, on arrival, to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>These hospitals were all splendidly equipped with X-ray departments
and pathological laboratories, and were well staffed with
medical and surgical specialists, highly trained nurses and orderlies.
When satisfactory progress had been made here, patients were
transferred to England to similar, though more highly specialized,
hospitals and convalescent homes, and finally, where necessary, were
invalided home to Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference between a General and a Stationary Hospital
was only in size, the former being primarily about twice the size of
the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nova Scotia contributed its quota to all these varied services,
including three complete Medical Units.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>COL. F. L. S. FORD, C.M.G.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The first Nova Scotia Unit to be accepted and mobilized for
Overseas Service with the First Contingent was a Medical Unit,
No. 2 Clearing Hospital, which had recently returned from annual
training at Sussex, N.B. Its headquarters was at Halifax and its
Commanding Officer Major F. L. S. Ford, who afterwards became
Colonel Ford, C.M.G., and was three
times mentioned in Sir Douglas Haig’s
despatches.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Unit afterwards became No. 1
Canadian Casualty Clearing Station and
had a most brilliant record, going
through the whole war service of the
Canadian Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after Great Britain entered
the War on August 4, 1914,
Major Ford telegraphed to Ottawa
offering his Unit for Active Service, and
on August 10th its mobilization was
ordered at Liverpool, N.S. On August 12th a recruiting meeting
occurred in the Town Hall, Liverpool, which was one of the first,
if not the first, public recruiting meeting held in Canada. This
meeting was addressed by Major Ford, the mayor of the town, and
a number of other citizens. There was a great deal of enthusiasm,
and then and there the Unit was recruited up to peace-time strength,
and in a few days orders were received to entrain on August 20,
1914, for Valcartier Training Camp, via Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the people of Queens County saw this first draft of the
flower of their young manhood march away in the King’s uniform
for service on the battle-fields of Europe, they felt that the War was
a real thing and had already reached their erst-while quiet, peaceful
homes. The send-off was appropriate to the occasion and the
people were proud of their noble sons who so promptly responded
to the call of Empire and bore themselves splendidly as they marched
away amidst the acclaim of their friends and comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Unit had always been recruited principally from Queens
and Annapolis Counties, but had members on its strength from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>over the Maritime Provinces and during the period of Active
Service had on its roll men from all parts of Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 11 a.m., August 22nd, the Unit arrived at Valcartier with six
officers and forty-one other ranks, who were soon mixed up in the
moil and swirl and grind of military training in that big Camp with
some thirty thousand others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers, N.C.O.’s and men who went to Valcartier from
Liverpool were: Major F. S. L. Ford, Commanding Officer; Capt.
H. T. M. McKinnon, Capt. C. Harold Dickson, Capt. G. B. Peat,
Lieut. H. A. Pickup, Q.M., Lieut. G. W. McKeen, Staff-Sergt. F.
Burnett, Staff-Sergt. E. Dexter, Staff-Sergt. E. Hunt, Q.M.S. R.
Robar, Staff-Sergt. R. Brown, Sergt. J. Fiendel, Sergt. McLeod;

N. Neily, M. Reid, L. Frost, W. Joudrey, W. Murray, H. Harnish,
E. Conrad, G. McGill, H. Rafuse, C. Fraser, C. Holden,

H. Oickle, C. Jollimore, S. White, A. Trefry, B. Smith, A. Joudrey,
L. Brooks, H. Lantz, J. Downer, G. Conrod, R. Bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arrival at Valcartier this Unit took over No. 2 Camp Hospital,
and carried on as a Field Hospital. The Staff was kept
pretty busy with the usual run of camp sickness among new recruits,
camp diarrhœa, acute indigestion, fevers, camp accidents, and the
usual P.U.O.’s and N.Y.D.’s thrown in.</p>

<p class='c007'>While at Valcartier, the O.C., Major Ford, was gazetted Lieut.-Colonel.
Capt. G. W. O. Downsley, Capt. C. E. Cooper Cole, and
forty other ranks of No. 1 Clearing Hospital of Toronto were taken
on the strength as well as Major H. A. Chisholm, Capt. R. H.
McDonald and Capt. J. M. Stewart. Lieut. G. W. McKeen was
transferred as Medical Officer to an Army Service Corps and
Captain Cole was retransferred to No. 2 General Hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 4.30 p.m., September 25th, the Unit left by train for Quebec
and embarked on the <em>S.S. Megantic</em> at 6 p.m. The other Units
to embark on this ship were: The 15th Canadian Battalion (48th
Highlanders), Lieut.-Col. John Currie; The 1st Divisional Ammunition
Column, Lieut.-Col. J. Penhole; No. 1 Canadian Field Ambulance,
Lieut.-Col. A. E. Ross.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>After lying in the stream for five days the ship weighed anchor
at 10.30 p.m. on September 30th and proceeded down the St. Lawrence
River to the rendezvous in Gaspé Bay, for there were thirty-one
troopships in this grand fleet which was to convey the Canadian
Army of thirty thousand safely over the ocean to Old Mother
England.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the good ship <em>Megantic</em> glided quietly down the river the
stars shone brightly, the silvery moon was high in the heavens, and
the clear frosty tang of early autumn was in the air. As the shimmering
waters of this great river glistened and danced in the moonlight
all nature seemed to have an air of serene quietude and universal
confidence. The scene might have been committed to canvas
as an emblem of peace; but this was a first stage in the great
adventure of war, the fullest bitterness of which many of that gay
company were destined to taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 3 p.m., October 3, 1914, this great flotilla weighed anchor
and put to sea, led by <em>H.M.S. Eclipse</em>, immediately followed by
the <em>Megantic</em>, containing the first Nova Scotia Medical Unit.
There were a number of torpedo boat destroyers, and among the
battleships were the <em>Queen Mary</em> and the <em>Glory</em>. After an
uneventful voyage of eleven days this great flotilla arrived at
Plymouth on October 14th. The reception given the Canadian
Contingent everywhere was wonderful. The sentiment back of it
all seemed to reach every heart. A splendid army of sturdy Anglo-Saxons
from a new and great country had come three thousand
miles over the seas to join the forces of the Mother Land within
two months from the time she had entered the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>After lying in the stream for two days the <em>Megantic</em> docked
and on October 16th the 1st Canadian Casualty Clearing Station
disembarked and marched midst cheering throngs through the
streets of Plymouth together with the other Units, and entrained
for the land of winter slush and mud at Salisbury Plains. At
2 a.m. on a pitch dark October morning the Unit detrained at
Patney and Chirton Station and marched to West Down North,
where they arrived tired and weary after a sleepless night and a
long march, at 7.30 a.m., October 17th.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Major H. A. Chisholm was called for duty to the office of the
A.D.M.S. Canadians shortly after arrival. Major Chisholm belonged
to Antigonish, and was a member of the Permanent Army
Medical Corps. He had a distinguished career Overseas and
attained the rank of Colonel and was mentioned in despatches and
awarded the honors of C.M.G. and D.S.O. He also held the important
positions of D.A.D.M.S. 1st Canadian Division; A.D.M.S.
4th Division; A.D.M.S. attached to the office of the D.G.M.S.
Canadians, London, and D.D.M.S., O.M.F.C., London.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unusually heavy autumn rains of 1914 converted the rolling
downs of Salisbury Plains into seas of mud, through which the
Unit wallowed and bathed and boated in its efforts to follow field
training. The troops were all under canvas at this time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Astor, then Major Astor, had a palatial residence and
spacious grounds at Cliveden, near Taplow, Bucks, the grounds of
which he offered for hospital purposes. In December No. 1 Canadian
C.C.S. was sent to Cliveden to establish a hospital, and for six
weeks the entire personnel was busy in these preparations. This
hospital, established by No. 1 Canadian Casualty Clearing Hospital
of Nova Scotia, ultimately developed into the great Duchess of
Connaught Hospital, afterwards officially known as No. 15 Canadian
General Hospital, upon which thousands of Canadians, Australians,
New Zealanders, South Africans and other Britishers can look back
with grateful memories for the skilful and successful treatment and
great kindness for which this hospital became noted.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Casualty Clearing Station is a field unit, and consequently
when the 1st Canadian Division was ordered to France this Unit
received a move order and preceded the Division to France, landing
at Le Havre at 10 a.m., February 3, 1915, on <em>S.S. Huanchaco</em>
from Southampton. On the same ship was another Canadian Hospital
Unit—No. 1 Canadian Stationary, commanded by Lieut.-Col.
Lorn Drum (now Colonel Lorn Drum, C.B.E., Inspector of Military
Hospitals for Canada). These, however, were not the first Canadian
Units in France, as they were preceded in November, 1914, by
a No. 2 Canadian Stationary Hospital, which was commanded in its
last days in France and brought back to Canada by the writer. This
was really the first Canadian Unit of any description to function in
France as a Unit and the only one in France in 1914.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>After some six weeks’ stay at Le Havre the Unit was transferred
to Boulogne, where it arrived at 9.45 a.m., February 26, 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>Motion was usually rapid in France and changes made at short
notice. Within a week this Unit had orders to proceed from Boulogne
to First Army Headquarters at the Town of Aire-Sur-La-Lys,
where it arrived Saturday morning, March 6th. On arrival the
Unit was assigned to Fort Gassion, which had been a French prison
before the War but was now occupied by British troops as a rest
camp, and there was also a Motor Ambulance Convoy billeted there.
The work assigned to No. 1 C.C.S. was to take over this old prison
and make it immediately ready for the reception of patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old buildings were filthy and in a dilapidated condition, and
required a great deal of work to prepare them for patients, and all
the equipment had to be unpacked and placed. The whole Unit
went to work with diligence and determination and within forty-eight
hours they brought order out of chaos and on Monday morning
admitted and comfortably housed fifty patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battle of Neuve Chapelle was in progress and was the
source of most of the patients during the week.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heroic work was done by the six nursing sisters who had been
attached to and had come over to France with this Unit. They
were:—Vivian Tremaine, M.V.O., R.R.C., Frances M. Frew, M. U.
Riverin, Amy Howard, Minnie Follette.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nursing Sister Follette, of Great Village, Colchester County,
afterwards lost her life with the sinking of the hospital ship
<em>Llandovery Castle</em> by the Germans.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 1 Canadian C.C.S. was the only Canadian Unit in action
during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. It was one of six C.C.S.’s
attached to the First Army. Before the War was over there were
sixteen. This Unit showed such prompt action and capacity that it
received the special commendation of Major-General Sir W. G.
MacPherson, Director Medical Services, First Army, and in June
the O.C., Lieut.-Colonel Ford, was awarded the C.M.G., the first
awarded to Canadians in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this engagement Capts. C. H. Dickson and G. W. O.
Downsley and a party of twelve orderlies were hastily sent to
Merville to assist a British C.C.S., and at the Second Battle of
Ypres, Captain Downsley and Captain J. M. Stewart, of Halifax,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>with Nursing Sister Follette and twelve orderlies were assigned to
duty at Hazebrouck to assist another British C.C.S.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was heavy fighting throughout the summer of 1915 in the
Bethune Sector, and No. 1 Canadian C.C.S. did a lot of heavy and
trying work, and in addition detailed a section under Major
W. T. M. McKinnon and Captain C. H. Dickson for duty with
No. 2 British C.C.S., which was located at the Village of Choques.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Unit continued its headquarters at Aire, and in May, June
and September took its full share in the herculean task of evacuating
the wounded from Festubert, Givenchy and Loos. During the
battle of Loos over sixty thousand casualties were evacuated from
the British Front by the various clearing stations in four days.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the outstanding distinctions of No. 1 Canadian C.C.S.
is that, when His Majesty King George V was seriously injured near
Bethune in August, 1915, by his horse falling and rolling over on
him, one of the nursing sisters of this Unit, V. A. Tremaine, was
selected by the Director Medical Services of the 1st Imperial Army
for personal attendance upon the King. His Majesty was cared
for in a chateau near Aire until he was able to be moved to England.
Sister Tremaine and a second nurse who had been selected, Nursing
Sister E. K. Ward, Q.A.I.M.N.S. Territorials, accompanied the
Royal patient and nursed His Majesty through convalescence at
Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Sister Tremaine finished her duties the King conferred
upon her the M.V.O. and personally presented her with the insignia
of that Order and made a personal gift of an exquisite brooch of
gold and enamel set with diamonds. Her Majesty the Queen gave
her autograph copies of the royal photographs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit continued to operate at Aire until January, 1916,
when it was transferred to Bailleul and opened up in a very fine
pavilion of the Asylum for the Insane. This splendid building was
subsequently destroyed by German shell fire and bombs. The Unit
saw much strenuous work here, and had its first experience with
gassed cases. Sixty of these out of eight hundred died within the
first twenty-four hours after being brought in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Edward Archibald, of No. 3 (McGill) Canadian General
Hospital, was attached to the Unit as a surgical specialist, and
Major W. A. McLean, of Glace Bay, N.S., was transferred from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>No. 1 Canadian General Hospital as his assistant, and afterwards
succeeded Major Archibald. Major McLean was killed during the
summer of 1917 while at work in a C.C.S. in the northern sector
of the British line. He was considered one of the most brilliant
surgeons in the British Army.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1916, Colonel Ford was appointed Deputy Assistant
Director of Medical Services of the Canadian Corps and Lieut.-Col.
T. W. H. Young succeeded to the command. Later Colonel Young
was succeeded by Major C. H. Dickson, who was promoted to the
rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a great deal of activity on the Arras Front in the
early spring of 1917, and preparations were being made for the
drive for Vimy Ridge. At this time the Unit was transferred to
Aubigny, behind Arras. Under the energetic administration of
Lieut.-Colonel Dickson this Unit was very much increased in
strength and did valuable work during the Battle of Vimy Ridge
and throughout the operations on the Arras Front.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the summer of 1917 the Unit was again moved to a position
near Nieuport and arrived just as the Germans had broken through
and made a nasty salient in the British line. Amidst this confusion,
uncertainty and fierce fighting, the Commanding Officer, Colonel
Dickson, quickly located his Unit and did such splendid work in
the evacuation of the wounded that he was mentioned in despatches
and awarded the D.S.O.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit remained at Nieuport for a few weeks only when the
position became untenable for hospital purposes, owing to almost
constant shelling and nightly bombing. Lieut.-Colonel Dickson was
called to London for Staff duty, the command was taken over by
Lieut.-Colonel A. G. H. Bennett, O.B.E., and the Unit was transferred
again to the Arras-Vimy Front.</p>

<p class='c007'>During those anxious days of the early spring and summer of
1918, while the Germans battered themselves hopelessly against the
impenetrable wall of steel erected by the Canadians along the Arras
Front this Unit did fine work in caring for and clearing the seriously
sick and wounded and also got many casualties from that memorable
drive of the Germans against the 5th British Army in March, 1918,
as all the Ambulance and C.C.S. Units in that area were quickly put
out of commission.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>When preparations were made for the final victorious Canadian
drive which commenced at Amiens on August 8, 1918, this Unit
was moved to that sector and followed the Canadian Corps through
those strenuous days to final victory and accompanied the 1st Canadian
Division on its victorious march into Germany. At Bonn
No. 1 Canadian Stationary Hospital took over the famous St.
Martin’s Hospital, which was located on one of the loftiest hills in
Bonn, and but two weeks before had dukes and scions of the leading
aristocracy of Germany as patients, for it had been one of the
most exclusive hospitals in Germany. Now it became the haven of
the sick Canadian Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed like the realization of a fantastic dream to the
medical Staff and nursing sisters, as well as the rank and file, to find
themselves in a modern and well-equipped hospital with luxurious
appointments and surroundings, as compared with four long years
of mud and mire under canvas, in huts, and often broken-down
buildings on the edge of the battle-fields of the Somme, Ypres, Vimy,
Passchendaele, Amiens, Bourlon, Cambrai and Valenciennes, Mons,
and then glorious victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is an incomplete list of the battle casualties of
this Unit:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>KILLED IN ACTION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Major Walter Maclean; Nursing Sisters Mae B. Sampson and
Minnie Follette, both killed on Hospital Ship <em>Llandovery Castle</em>;
Pte Proctor, Pte. Vere Mason.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WOUNDED.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Lieut.-Col. F. S. L. Ford, seriously, by piece of bombshell
(fracture base of skull); Capt. E. C. C. Cole, seriously; Capt. R. H.
MacDonald, Sergeant M. Neilly, seriously.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NO. 7 CANADIAN STATIONARY HOSPITAL.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(Dalhousie Unit.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dalhousie University was early inspired with patriotic fervor.
Within a month after the outbreak of war between Great Britain
and Germany, Dalhousie University offered to the Government the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>personnel of a Casualty Clearing Station. This offer was renewed
in the spring of 1915. It was not known until later that this type
of Unit was not in demand, and it was decided to offer the personnel
of a Stationary Hospital.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_189.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>COL. JOHN STEWART, C.B.E.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So anxious was Dalhousie to have a definite, tangible part in
the more strenuous service of the nation in this great struggle, that
a delegation was sent to Ottawa on
August 13, 1915, representing the
Governors and Faculty of the University.
So well were the claims of
Dalhousie presented that the offer was
now accepted of a Stationary Hospital,
to be known officially as “No. 7 Canadian
Stationary Hospital.” Definite
authority for this was received on
September 27, 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it came to the selection of a
Commanding Officer everybody turned
instinctively to that great outstanding
factotum in Medicine and Surgery in Nova Scotia, Dr. John
Stewart, whose name inspired enthusiasm, confidence and respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Halifax was taxed to its utmost in supplying accommodation
for troops. All the old military barracks were full, the Armories
were occupied by infantry Battalions, the sheds on No. 2 Pier were
also occupied, and there was consequently some delay in finding
accommodation for the mobilization and training of this Hospital
Unit. Dalhousie University came to the rescue and gave the old
Medical College building on the corner of Robie and College
Streets, and Principal Kaulbach, of the Maritime Business College,
gave the use of the dining room and kitchen of the Business
College restaurant as a mess room. By November 1st the old
Medical College had been converted into an adequate barracks and
orderly room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The selection of the medical and nursing personnel and the
recruiting of other ranks then commenced in earnest and the
response was wonderful. For a Stationary Hospital only twelve
medical officers and twenty-seven nursing sisters were required:
but thirty medical men and eighty nurses applied. The material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>was all so excellent that it was a delicate and difficult task to select.
Preference was given, however, to Dalhousie graduates and those
connected with the University; and among the nurses preference
was given to graduates of the two outstanding Nova Scotia nurses’
training hospitals, the Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, and St.
Joseph’s Hospital, Glace Bay, as these were the only general hospitals
in the Province with the necessary number of beds to meet
the requirements of the Military Service in the matter of training.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before orders were received to proceed Overseas in the
latter part of December, 1915, the Unit was inspected by General
Benson, G.O.C. of this Military District, Colonel A. H. Powell,
D.A.A. &amp; Q.M.G., and Colonel Grant, A.D.M.S. These officers
were very generous in their praises of what the Unit had already
accomplished in the way of training and establishing a snappy
military organization. Their sturdy Commanding Officer, with his
sixty-seven years of youth, had shown his magnificent qualities of
body as well as mind and character. When Colonel Stewart set
the pace on their route marches the youngest and most athletic had
to let himself out. Colonel Grant, the A.D.M.S., referred to the
splendid work already done in the service by members of the Staff,
and mentioned particularly the work done by Major E. V. Hogan
as Chief of Surgery at Cogswell Street Military Hospital and Major
L. M. Murray as Chief of Medicine; and also expressed his regret
at losing his Deputy, Capt. F. V. Woodbury, but congratulated the
Unit on what it had gained thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time set for leaving Halifax for Overseas was December
31, 1915, via St. John, N.B. The departure at one time of so
many professional men and women, who stood high in the confidence
of the people of Halifax and Nova Scotia, was a poignant
reminder of the serious proportions assumed by the Great War.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the evening of the last day of 1915, when Dalhousie Unit
entrained at North Street Depot, a large concourse of people were
assembled, not only of Halifax but from many other parts of the
Province. The bands of the 1st Canadian Artillery and 63rd
Rifles, as well as the pipers, joined the citizens of Nova Scotia in a
fitting farewell. Their train pulled out amidst music and cheers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit arrived at St. John at 6 a.m., New Year’s Day, and
went aboard His Majesty’s Troopship <em>Metagama</em>. At noon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>officers were entertained at luncheon by the medical profession of
St. John at the Royal Hotel. The Unit sailed at 9 o’clock on the
evening of January 1, 1916, with several other Units, with Col.
H. C. Bickford as Officer Commanding troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sea voyages are pretty much alike. There are those who like
their beer and poker, or bridge, and those who like to laze and read
and sleep and sleep and read and laze, or sit and think, or simply
sit, while others wish they had taken the advice of the poet—“Praise
the sea but keep on land.” A convoy of torpedo boat
destroyers was met at noon on the eighth day out, and at 3 a.m. on
January 10th the Unit landed at Plymouth and disembarked at
9 a.m.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personnel on arriving in England was as follows: O.C.,
Lieut.-Col. John Stewart; Majors E. V. Hogan and L. M. Murray;
Captains M. A. MacAulay, V. N. MacKay, K. A. MacKenzie,
E. K. Maclellan, S. J. MacLennan, D. A. MacLeod, J. A. Murray,
John Rankine, Frank V. Woodbury, Karl F. Woodbury (Dental
Officer), Lieut. S. R. Balcom, Dispenser; Lieut. Walter Taylor,
Quartermaster; Miss L. M. Hubley, Matron, and twenty-six
Nursing Sisters; one hundred and twenty-three N.C.O.’s and men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers, non-commissioned officers and men entrained at
once for Shorncliffe, where they arrived in the evening, while the
matron and nursing sisters proceeded to London and were temporarily
quartered at Bonnington Hotel. They were afterwards
distributed for duty between the hospitals at Westcliffe, Moore
Barracks and Ramsgate.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 11th the Unit was inspected by Lieut.-Col. F. W. E.
Wilson, of Niagara, Ontario, A.D.M.S. Shorncliffe area.</p>

<p class='c007'>Billets were secured and the medical officers were employed on
medical boards or as medical officers to various Units in the training
camps, while the non-commissioned officers and men were assigned
to various duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>On January 17th Capt. F. V. Woodbury was stricken with that
dread disease among troops, cerebro-spinal meningitis. For some
days there was great anxiety on his account, but he made a rapid
and complete recovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>On February 5th Colonel Stewart, O.C. of No. 7 Canadian
Stationary Hospital, was given command of Shorncliffe Military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Hospital, with the forty subsidiary hospitals of the Dover area, in
succession to Lieut.-Col. R. J. Blanchard, No. 3 C.C.S., of Winnipeg.
He immediately recalled the nursing sisters and reassembled his
Unit, and with his reorganized Staff manned Shorncliffe Military
General Hospital and the Helena Hospital for officers. The Shorncliffe
Hospital alone had 800 beds, and altogether there were some
10,000 beds in the hospitals taken over. Colonel Stewart and his
Staff had a pretty busy time administering the hospitals of this
large area. Sir Frederic Eve visited these hospitals periodically.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this time there were some changes in personnel: Corpls.
G. S. Mitchell and Eric Grant left to take commissions; Capt. S. J.
MacLennan went to Westcliffe Eye and Ear Hospital. Capt. E.
Douglas joined the Unit during the latter part of the period here
and sixteen other ranks were taken on strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much excitement and anticipation when it was
announced that the Unit was to proceed to France. The impression
got abroad somehow that the Unit was to go direct to the
Arras and Somme areas, where they would be in close contact with
actual warfare. This was the source of a good deal of enthusiasm.
The Unit left Shorncliffe and proceeded to Southampton on Sunday,
June 18, 1916, embarked there on the <em>City of Benares</em> and landed
at Le Havre the same day. On arrival the Unit received orders to
take over the Hotel des Emigrants at Le Havre from No. 2 Imperial
General Hospital, which contained 400 beds. This was somewhat
disappointing to the men after their anticipations of proceeding at
once to the Front. However, all ranks settled down to steady work,
and in a few weeks orders were received to establish a subsidiary
tented hospital Unit at Harfleur, about six miles from Le Havre,
to consist of 400 additional beds. This meant that the existing
Staff had to man two hospitals of the same size, thus bringing a
very heavy strain on the entire personnel, especially the nursing
sisters and other ranks. Major L. M. Murray was placed in charge
of the Harfleur Division.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main hospital was used for German wounded prisoners
being sent back from the forward areas and for local sick from
various Imperial Units at Le Havre. The subsidiary hospital was
used for camp sick and accidents from the Canadian Base and
several Imperial Units.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>As soon as these extensions were completed and in operation
an urgent request was sent in for more men. Eventually a much
larger number were sent than were required of P.B. men. (Permanent
Base men are those who are no longer fit for service in the
front areas.) These were with the Unit only a few days when
orders were received to despatch to hospitals in another area a draft
larger in number than the one received. This took away several old
members of the Unit and left it shorter handed than ever, but the
Unit “carried on” and did its work under difficulties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Constant changes were taking place in the staff. Capt. J. M.
Stewart, nephew of the O.C., came to the Unit shortly after arrival
in France from No. 1 C.C.S., and in August, 1916, Capt. F. V.
Woodbury, Capt. M. A. MacAulay, Capt. John Rankine and Capt.
Edgar Douglas were posted to other duties. Capt. E. K. Maclellan
was posted to another hospital in March, 1917. Numerous officers
from other parts of Canada were detailed for duty with this Unit
from time to time. One of the most popular of these was Captain
Ireland, of Ontario, who afterwards received the M.C. and was
killed in action.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 31, 1916, the hospital at Le Havre was handed
over to the Royal Army Medical Corps and the personnel of Dalhousie
Unit, which had been carrying on there, marched to Harfleur
and joined the balance of the Unit. Once more the whole Unit
was united and experienced a very general sense of satisfaction.
Ample provision had been made for quarters, mess, dental offices
and orderly room.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January and February, 1917, the weather was very severe,
with steady, keen frost and a good deal of snow, “But,” as Colonel
Stewart puts it, “the bitterest memories are the indescribable mud,
deep, tenacious and slippery.” As spring approached it looked as
if the summer were to be spent in the beautiful Lezard Valley, in
which Harfleur was situated, and consequently potatoes and other
vegetables were planted, shrubs set out and other work done with a
view to beautifying the grounds. It was beginning to seem quite
like home here. All the troops coming to France en route to the
Front came through this base, and many Nova Scotians were met
and old acquaintances renewed. Also a good many Nova Scotia
boys trickled in to the hospital, and when they did they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>lavished with attention, and all the nurses and orderlies wanted to
wait on them, and the pipers, too, would manage to make themselves
heard and many a lad’s eye was made brighter when he heard
again the skirl o’ the pipes.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no abiding place in France, and it was just as one
got nicely settled down that he had to move, and at this very time
the Unit got orders to proceed to the front areas and take over a
hospital at Arques, which is a suburb of the City of St. Omer.
Headed by the pipers the Unit marched off to the station Saturday
evening, May 12th, but did not entrain until daylight the next
morning when a special train was provided for the Unit and its
hospital equipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hospital at Harfleur was taken over by a Welsh Unit, the
40th Stationary Hospital, R.A.M.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>The route was through Yvetot, Amiens, Abbeville and over the
Somme, past the former battle-field of Crecy, through Boulogne
and Calais to St. Omer and to the little suburban town of Arques,
which was reached at 2 a.m., May 14, 1917. The rumble of the
artillery could now be plainly heard, and the eastern sky was
aflicker with the flashings of guns. The Unit was now within
thirty miles of the trenches. A noble old French Chateau with
spacious grounds, and a canal running through them, was to be
the domicile of the hospital. This same chateau had been occupied
by the Duke of Wellington after the campaign of Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tents were pitched on the grounds to supply the additional
accommodations required, and the hospital equipment was soon
unpacked and placed; but there was considerable delay in getting
the necessary supplies for the erection of kitchens, bath houses,
pavilions, and material for other necessary alterations and accommodations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first convoy was received on June 8th and consisted of
wounded German prisoners of war. There were 13 officers and
379 other ranks. This was a large order for the first while not yet
completely ready, and tested the resourcefulness and agility of the
Unit. They rose to the occasion and handled the situation with
great skill. Many of the men were only slightly wounded, and
were soon discharged to prison camps.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>From this time on everybody was kept busy. Wounded came
by ambulances, hospital trains and hospital barges down the canal.
There were Imperial, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, East
Indian and Portuguese troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dominion Day, 1917, will long be remembered by the inhabitants
of St. Omer and vicinity. The Unit engaged a large field and
advertised an athletic meet, and sent invitations to all the Units in
the area. They all responded, for when July 1st came, bright and
sunny, the whole countryside turned out, including the civilian
population. A splendid programme of sports was carried out, and
No. 7 carried off a goodly share of the honors. In the shade of
the trees of the chateau grounds in the evening tables were spread
and the Unit sat down to a “family party” and enjoyed a season
of conviviality and good fellowship.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next afternoon all patients who were able to be up, or to be
carried out, were given a special tea on the lawn in honor of
Dominion Day. While this was going on His Majesty the King
with H.R.H. the Prince of Wales paid the Unit a surprise visit.
His Majesty was particularly gracious in his felicitations to patients
and Staff, by all of whom the honor of this visit was greatly
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the summer the enemy aeroplanes were very active in
bombing raids on the back areas, especially on moonlight nights.
The first real bombing raid this Unit experienced was on September
30th. Enemy aeroplanes came over this area in great force
shortly after sundown and began dropping numerous bombs. The
loud swish of the bombs coming through the air followed by the
fearful crash of the explosion was terrifying; but everybody,
nursing sisters and all, “stood to” at their post of duty. Although
No. 7 escaped there were serious casualties. Four men were killed
and several wounded at the British Hospital just across the river,
and four nursing sisters and sixteen men were killed at the Scottish
Hospital in St. Omer, only two miles distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 8th H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught visited and
inspected the Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first word of the terrific explosion at Halifax was received
on December 8th, and many anxious days were spent awaiting
definite word and to know just what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Colonel Stewart, was called to
the higher and more important duties of Surgical Consultant to
hospitals in England and left the Unit, greatly to the regret of the
entire personnel, on Thursday, March 7, 1918. The command of
the Unit was taken over by Major E. V. Hogan, who was promoted
to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>March and April, 1918, brought still more busy days to the
Dalhousie Unit. Being so near the Front they received a very
large number of wounded, many straight from the field of battle.
Although this hospital had only 400 beds it frequently had 800
severely wounded soldiers to look after.</p>

<p class='c007'>The final titanic struggles of 1918 had been ushered in when
the fate of the world hung in a balance and men spoke hoarsely
and with bated breath of the possible outcome. The Germans had
smashed through the Fifth British Army in front of Cambrai and
then hurled themselves against the Canadians on the Arras Front,
only to be checked and beaten off. Then they sought a more
vulnerable sector and attacked the Portuguese on the Bailleul Front.
The Portuguese troops gave way and the enemy rapidly advanced
towards Aire and got within less than three miles of this strategic
point and were able to put shells into St. Omer, Arques and all
sections of that hospital area, so that shelling became more or less
constant and bombing raids were a nightly occurrence. There
were a number of casualties among patients and Staff at some of the
hospitals. Word was hourly expected that Aire had been taken
and that the Germans were marching on Hazebrouck and St. Omer.
It was therefore considered that this area was no longer tenable
for hospital purposes and orders were issued for all hospitals to
evacuate at once. Dalhousie Unit entrained on April 18th for
Etaples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit had received orders to promptly open up a large tent
hospital at Etaples; but these orders were subsequently cancelled,
greatly to the disappointment of the Staff, and the entire personnel
was posted to various other hospitals in that area.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Germans seemed to have acquired a special fancy for
bombing and shooting up hospital areas, and on May 18th subjected
Etaples to a very severe aerial bombardment by sixty planes.
Casualties among officers, nursing sisters and men amounted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>over a thousand. Dalhousie Unit lost two men killed—Pte. F. W.
Laidlaw and Pte. Takanayagi (Jap.)—and two others wounded,
including the Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Col. E. V. Hogan, and
Pte. W. G. O’Tulle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Etaples had been a large hospital centre, but was now abandoned
as such and the various hospitals were withdrawn to other places.
The Dalhousie Unit was moved to Rouen, which was the largest
base hospital centre in France. Here the officers and personnel
were distributed and attached to various British Hospitals and had
a further enriched experience, as there were very many casualties
constantly coming in direct from the field of battle, owing to the
demoralization of the hospital service in the front areas during the
period of the German drive. Most of the nursing sisters had been
allowed to go on leave, and some were sent to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>A special Canadian Hospital was to be established at Camiers,
between Etaples and Boulogne, and Dalhousie Unit was ordered,
in September, 1918, to reassemble and proceed to Camiers and
take over a hospital of 1,000 beds at a site formerly occupied by
No. 42 British Stationary Hospital. In the five months that followed
this hospital was crowded and the patients were all Canadians.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was during this period that the Armistice came with its
relaxing influences, its glorious sweets of victory, and happy dreams
of home. Christmas also brought its good-cheer and was most
pleasantly celebrated by the patients as well as the Staff with a
splendid Christmas dinner and other festivities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in February, 1919, the Unit received orders to hand over
to the Nova Scotia sister Unit, No. 9 Canadian Stationary Hospital—the
St. Francis Xavier Unit—and proceed to Le Havre en route to
England and Canada. The Unit sailed from Le Havre on March
17, 1919, for Southampton, arriving there in the afternoon. The
stay in England lasted only a month, but this was ample time for
all the members of the Unit to visit different parts of the British
Isles.</p>

<p class='c007'>During its service the Dalhousie Unit treated some 60,000 sick
and wounded, 10,000 in England and 50,000 in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>On April 17, 1919, a happy group of Nova Scotians assembled
on the docks at Liverpool and boarded the good ship <em>Belgic</em> with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>3,500 other Canadian troops for Home, Sweet Home. On April
23rd that goodly company landed in Halifax and were greeted by a
people proud of their noble sons returned with the laurels of
victory. That happy group of Nova Scotians now assembled on
the pier at Halifax and were given an ovation and cheered to the
echo as they marched through the streets to the Armories to be
demobilized. These were they who had gone in the honored name
of Old Dalhousie. Well did they guard the honor of that name,
and long may Dalhousie and Nova Scotia be proud of the record
and deeds of the Dalhousie Unit.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NO. 9 CANADIAN STATIONARY HOSPITAL</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(St. Francis Xavier College Unit).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With characteristic enterprise St. Francis Xavier College decided,
as the War went on, that it should stand side by side with
other Universities of Canada in direct representation. In the
autumn of 1915 the President and Governors offered a Medical
Unit for Overseas. This seemed the most fitting service for a great
Christian and humanitarian institution, and it was understood that
hospitals were in demand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Dr. H. P. MacPherson, President of the University, took the
matter up direct with the Government of Canada, and in April,
1916, authority was given for the acceptance of No. 9 Canadian
Stationary Hospital from St. Francis Xavier.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_202.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. R. C. M‘LEOD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This announcement was received with great enthusiasm, and it
was decided not to send the Unit away empty-handed. A subscription
list was opened and friends of the
University were given an opportunity to
subscribe to a fund to provide for some
special equipment and to organize a band.
The response was most generous, and in
a very short time an ample amount of
money was secured. Besides private subscriptions,
liberal donations were received
from the Red Cross, Daughters of the
Empire, Knights of Columbus and other
societies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Busy days followed in selecting the
personnel and organizing the Unit. No
recruiting campaign was necessary. The loyal sons of St. Francis
and daughters of Antigonish, and many others everywhere, were
offering their services. As the brokers would say: “The stock was
over-subscribed.” And it was a matter of selection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The command was given to Lieut.-Col. Roderick C. McLeod,
who had already enlisted in the C.E.F. and was daily expecting
orders to proceed Overseas. Colonel McLeod was a graduate of
St. Francis Xavier and had attained a wide reputation as a successful
medical practitioner of North Sydney. He was a man of
a most genial personality and beloved by all who knew him. His
appointment to the command of this Unit was hailed with universal
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel McLeod was assisted in the work of organization by
Major H. E. Kendall as second in command, an outstanding
surgeon of Cape Breton; and Major J. S. Carruthers, an energetic
Militia officer, was appointed adjutant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enthusiasm among nurses for service in this Unit was
remarkable. Applications poured in from every Province in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Canada and from many parts of the United States, by mail and
telegraph. Miss S. C. MacIsaac, a graduate of Mt. St. Bernard
Convent, of Antigonish, was chosen as Matron. Miss MacIsaac
was trained as a nurse at St. Joseph’s Hospital, Glace Bay, in
which institution she had charge of the operating room for three
years. She had taken a post-graduate course at Mercy Hospital,
Chicago, and when war broke out she was Assistant Matron at
Mt. Zion Hospital, San Francisco. Miss MacIsaac therefore
came to her new, important and strenuous post well qualified.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the Unit was completed at the University
Town of Antigonish, the seat of the mother College, St. Francis
Xavier. The college authorities and citizens of Antigonish vied
with each other in extending an enthusiastic reception to the volunteers
as they came, and everything was done to make their stay
pleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Orders were issued from headquarters for the Unit to mobilize
at Halifax in the spring of 1916. The officers took the C.A.M.C.
Training Course at Cogswell Street Military Hospital, and the
nursing sisters were also posted there, and faithful work was done
in a general course of preliminary training.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original personnel was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. Roderick C. MacLeod, Commanding Officer; Major
Henry E. Kendall, Second in Command; Major J. Stewart Carruthers,
Adjutant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Medical Officers: Capts. Alex. R. Campbell, J. F. Ellis, T. A.
Lebbetter, A. H. MacKinnon, J. I. O’Connell, L. D. Densmore,
Hon. Capt. J. L. Johnson, Capts. R. MacCuish, J. A. McCourt,
L. J. Violette, Hon. Lieut. Leo F. Fry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nursing Sisters: Emma Ella Barry, Laura Emily Campbell,
Sarah Catherine Chisholm, Monica Connell, Isabel Helen Dawson,
Helena Margaret Ellis, Florence Mary Kelly, Nellie King, Annie
MacDonald, Annie Helen MacDonald, Catharine Chisholm MacDonald,
Catharine Eileen MacDonald, Catharine Tulloch MacDonald,
Jessie MacDonald, Minnie Frances MacDonald, Flora
MacDougall, Mary MacGrath, Sadie Catharine MacIsaac
(Matron), Christena Mary MacKenzie, Dora MacKenzie, Annie
Tremaine MacLeod, Marcella Agnes O’Brien, Catharine Regina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Shea, Edith Alexander Thompson, Mary S. Walsh, Anna Teresa
Young.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was not long in receiving orders to proceed Overseas,
and on June 19, 1916, set sail per <em>S.S. Missinabie</em>. After ten
days’ sail on typical summer seas a landing was made at Liverpool.
Here the jolly family group was divided and the officers and men
were sent to Shorncliffe and attached for instruction and duty to
Shorncliffe Military Hospital, while the matron and nursing sisters
entrained for London, where they were detailed, by the Matron-in-Chief,
for duty to various hospitals in England.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>CAPT. K. A. M‘CUISH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This was a sort of a period of orphanage; but in exactly three
months, September 29, 1916, the Unit was again reassembled for
the purpose of taking over the Bramshott Military Hospital, No.
12 Canadian General Hospital, which served the large military
training camps of Bramshott and Witley. This was a splendid
experience and training for the entire personnel. A great deal of
excellent work was done. The Medical Division was taken charge
of by Major Charles Hunter, of Winnipeg,
and Major H. E. Kendall was in
charge of the Surgical Division, assisted
by Capt. K. A. McCuish.</p>

<p class='c007'>While acting as the Medical Officer
of the 5th C.M.R.’s Captain McCuish
received wounds at Passchendaele, from
which he died. He was buried in the
Military Cemetery at Remi Siding, near
Poperinghe, Belgium, in a hero’s grave,
and now “sleeps where poppies grow
in Flanders fields.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The winter of 1917 taxed the capacity
of the hospital to the utmost, as well as the endurance of the
Staff, owing to a very severe outbreak of influenza in the Bramshott
area. The splendid manner in which the Unit rose to the great
demands made upon it and coped with the serious condition that
arose, called for special commendation from Major-General Foster,
Director-General of the Canadian Medical Services.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Here the first great sorrow came to the Unit in the illness
and death of their beloved Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Colonel
MacLeod. He contracted anthrax poisoning, from which he died
January 4, 1917. With military honors and amidst a large concourse
of sorrowing comrades he was laid to rest in the cemetery
at Bramshott.</p>

<p class='c007'>Command of the Unit was taken by Major H. E. Kendall, who
was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. Lieut.-Colonel Gilmore
of Toronto took charge of the surgical section.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spring of 1917 was a very hard period, as was also the fall
of 1917. The damp and chilly English climate was very trying to
new Canadian troops, and there was a large amount of sickness.
A good many battle casualties were also received from France.</p>

<p class='c007'>A call came from France for more Canadian hospitals, and
No. 9 Canadian Stationary Hospital was selected. The Unit was
ordered to proceed to France, and sailed from Folkestone in
December, 1917, landing at Boulogne the same day with the following
officers: Lieut.-Col. H. E. Kendall, Officer Commanding;
Major Charles Hunter, Major Adair, Quartermaster; Capt. J.
Williams, Pathologist; Capt. H. L. Reazin, Capt. J. W. Lord, Capt.
Andrew Love, Capt. W. F. MacIsaac, Capt. A. F. Slayter, Capt.
D. A. Webb, Capt. J. Wilfred, Hon. Capt. J. O. Ralston, Chaplain;
Hon. Capt. P. White, Chaplain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major Adair was subsequently Quartermaster at No. 3 Canadian
General Hospital at Boulogne, where he died suddenly of
uræmia following influenza in the spring of 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arrival in Boulogne the Unit received orders to proceed to
Longuenesse, near St. Omer, and open a hospital of four hundred
beds. Here everything was found to be in readiness. There were
hutted  wards of corrugated iron, wooden administration buildings
complete in every detail and ready for occupation. There was an
excellent, well-lighted, well-ventilated and thoroughly-equipped
operating room. The quarters provided for officers, nursing sisters
and men were all that could be desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only a few days before the Unit was ready to carry on,
and early in January, 1918, the first convoy was received, consisting
of over one hundred wounded soldiers from the Front. Excellent
and steady work then continued.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>In February instructions were received from headquarters to
enlarge the hospital to nine hundred beds. With willing hands and
enthusiastic workers this was soon completed, and during the month
of March a great many surgical cases were dealt with. Capt. A.
Loos and Capt. A. F. Slater were the surgical specialists at this
time. On account of the large number of surgical cases application
was made for assistants. Capt. T. MacGregor, a noted Scotch
surgeon of Glasgow, was sent for temporary duty. The officer in
charge of the Medical Division was Capt. H. L. Reazin, a successful
and well-known practitioner of Toronto.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the spring of 1918 the St. Francis Hospital Unit carried
on under precisely the same conditions of harassing shell fire and
nightly bombing as described in connection with the Dalhousie
Medical Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nursing sisters and hospital Staff displayed great courage
all through these trying times, remaining at their posts in the
operating room and hospital wards. No pen can describe the nerve-testing
and nerve-wracking experience of hearing the swish through
the air of those terrible and deadly bombs, then the terrific explosions
and rocking and trembling of the earth which meant destruction
and death to many. The way those splendid young women
carried themselves was magnificent. Without a quiver or the
slightest hesitation they kept right along with their work and
soothed and encouraged and ministered to their patients. They
were the same living contradiction here as elsewhere to all logical
relations, and the harmony of things. They would jump up on
the operating table and scream at the suggestion of a mouse or
trench rat; but would go out into the storm and darkness and fire
to give a drink of water to a wounded soldier.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was making preparations to still further expand the
bed capacity of the hospital when orders were issued for all hospitals
in the area to evacuate at once. The wounded were sent by
ambulance trains to the base, the equipment was packed up, and on
April 19th the Unit moved to Etaples, which is a fishing village
about twenty miles from Boulogne. It was a large hospital area
and there were 25,000 available beds.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the outskirts of the town near the village of Le Faux a site
was provided for the St. Francis Unit. The nursing sisters were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>detailed for duty to No. 1 Canadian General Hospital and No. 7
Canadian General Hospital. The officers and men were under canvas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was under instructions to open a tent hospital of 600
beds, and the work was progressing rapidly when that terrible air
raid came at 10 o’clock in the evening of May 18th and continued
for nearly two hours. The casualties were very heavy and every
hospital suffered. A number of live bombs dropped within the
small area occupied by the St. Francis Unit. Two men were instantly
killed and thirteen wounded. The killed were Sergeants
MacMillen and Taylor. They were buried in the Military Cemetery
at Etaples. Seventeen hospital marquees of the Unit were destroyed
during this raid. It was fortunate that the Unit had not
commenced receiving patients.</p>

<p>COL. R. ST. JOHN MACDONALD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the medical officers, Capt W. F. MacIsaac, of Antigonish,
was badly wounded, and succumbed to his injuries in No. 1
Canadian General Hospital on June 3rd. He was a young man of
brilliant attainments, exemplary character and a promising young
surgeon. He too was buried in the Military
Cemetery at Etaples. The whole
Unit was in attendance at the funeral.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since a large part of the hospital
equipment was destroyed it was decided
to move the Unit to another area. All
the railways were congested and every
other means of transportation taxed to
the utmost; consequently no means of
moving the equipment could be obtained,
and it remained packed for several
months. Most of the officers and men
were detailed for duty to other hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. H. E. Kendall was recalled for duty to England on
August 28, 1918, and command of the Unit fell to Major R. St. J.
MacDonald, who had been posted to the Unit a few months
previously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit was instructed to be in readiness to open up a Convalescent
Hospital for the Canadian Corps. But before this was
carried out the Germans made an unconditional surrender which
they were allowed to call an Armistice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Hopes were now high for an early, in fact, immediate return
home, and this became the all-absorbing topic of conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. A. Sterling, Capt. S. MacKenzie, Capt. G. Zwicker, Capt.
G. Phillips and Capt. S. Whitehouse arrived from England on
November 20th and joined the Unit. Capt. Sterling had gone
Overseas as a combatant officer with the R.C.R.’s and saw considerable
fighting. Owing to the scarcity of medical officers in the
summer of 1917 he was asked to transfer to the Medical Corps, which
he did, and was posted to the Canadian Special Hospital at Etching
Hill, where he remained until joining No. 9 Canadian Stationary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major S. L. Walker was posted to this Unit on November 25,
1918, and was afterwards promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.
He had been on active service with various Units since the spring
of 1915. Colonel Walker was an excellent administrative officer
and added strength to the Staff as second in command.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit received instructions to take over the special hospital
at Camiers from the Dalhousie Unit, which had received orders to
proceed to England en route to Canada. This change took place
on February 8, 1919, and St. Francis Unit took over the hospital
with 900 patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time the number of patients increased to 1,100 and
St. Francis Unit had the honor of being raised to the status of a
General Hospital. This gave an opportunity for some well-merited
promotions among the officers, non-commissioned officers and men.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time the Staff was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The stay at Camiers was made more pleasant for the personnel
and patients by the attention paid to recreation and amusements.
A baseball league was formed for the area and many good games
were played, in which there was a great deal of enthusiastic interest.
There was also much interest taken in tennis and quoits. A
moving-picture theatre was constructed and equipped by the Canadian
Y.M.C.A., under Capt. A. E. Hagar, which was an unfailing
source of pleasure to the patients and personnel. The Y.M.C.A.
also established a canteen and furnished a reading room. The
Red Cross too, through its representative, Major F. Murphy,
contributed very largely to the success of the Unit by providing
comforts for the patients and a large amount of sporting equipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thrill of pleasant anticipation ran through the Unit when on
May 20th orders were received that the patients were to be evacuated
at once with a view to demobilization and return to Canada.
As soon as the patients were evacuated no time was lost in turning
the hospital equipment and supplies in to Ordnance Stores. This
was completed on May 28th and on May 30th the Unit moved to
Boulogne, crossed to Folkestone the same afternoon and arrived
at Witley Camp, Surrey, the next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a very pleasant month in England, occupied mostly with
leave-taking and renewing old acquaintances, the Unit proceeded
to Southampton and embarked on the <em>S.S. Olympic</em> for Halifax
on July 2nd, together with No. 7 Canadian General Hospital
(Queens) and No. 4 Canadian General Hospital (Toronto).</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 8th at 6 p.m., after a voyage of only six days, these
happy home-comers were docked at Halifax. The Unit was met
by representatives of St. Francis Xavier College, whose name it
had the honor of bearing, led by Dr. J. J. Tompkins. Dr. Tompkins
invited the officers, non-commissioned officers and men to a reception
as well as farewell banquet at the “Green Lantern.” Other
guests present were Governor Grant, Hon. R. E. Faulkner, Hon.
Senator Crosby, Col. John Stewart, Lieut.-Col. E. V. Hogan and
John Neville. After an excellent supper the Unit was welcomed
home in a very happy manner by Dr. Tompkins, Governor Grant
and others. Col. R. St. J. MacDonald and Lieut.-Col. S. L.
Walker replied on behalf of the Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The following morning, July 9th, the Unit was demobilized
after over three years’ service Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire personnel had changed since leaving Halifax for
Overseas, and on demobilization was as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL SERVICES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Less than half the Nova Scotia medical men who went Overseas
served with the Nova Scotia Medical Units. This narrative would
therefore be very incomplete without reference to the major
portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of these had distinguished service with the Royal Army
Medical Corps (R.A.M.C.) and with other Canadian and Imperial
Hospitals, as well as with the fighting Units as Regimental Medical
Officers and other general and special duties.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Be it said to the honor of Nova Scotia that the organizing and
directing genius of the Canadian Army Medical Service was supplied
by two Nova Scotians, Major-Gen. Guy Carleton Jones,
C.M.G., who was born in Nova Scotia and practised his profession
in Halifax, and Major-Gen. G. L. Foster, C.B., who was born in
Nova Scotia and also practised his profession in Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Jones went Overseas with the First Canadian Contingent
as A.D.M.S. and shortly after arrival in England was made
Director of Medical Services, Canadian Expeditionary Force, with
headquarters in London, which he organized and administered
with great ability until he was made Medical Inspector, Canadian
Expeditionary Force, in 1917. Later he became D.M.S. in charge
of hospitals in Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Foster succeeded General Jones as D.M.S. Canadian
Expeditionary Force and later was made D.G.M.S., O.M.F.C., and
successfully carried on the duties of that high and difficult office
until the end of the War and the demobilization of the Canadian
Army.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another outstanding Nova Scotia Medical Officer was Lieut.-Col.
H. M. Jacques. When the First Contingent left, Colonel
Jacques became Acting D.G.M.S., Ottawa. He was A.D.M.S.
2nd Canadian Division in France; he was three times mentioned
for distinguished service in Sir Douglas Haig’s dispatches and was
promoted to the full rank of Colonel and awarded the D.S.O. and
Bar for distinguished and gallant service in action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nursing service has also brought great credit to Nova
Scotia, and it is a further honor to the Province that the Canadian
Army Nursing Service was under the direction of a Nova Scotian.
The Matron-in-Chief was Miss Margaret C. MacDonald, of Bailey
Brook. She was mentioned for distinguished services and awarded
the R.R.C. She had seen active service in the Spanish-American
War and was selected to accompany the Second Canadian Contingent
to South Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a synopsis of the Military Services of Nova
Scotia medical men not previously mentioned, as far as can be
obtained. It has been impossible to get a complete authentic record,
and although every medical man on the Medical Register for the
Province, who was known to have been in the military service, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>written to personally for information, only thirty replies were
received to 150 letters. The list is therefore liable to some errors
and omissions.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NURSING SERVICE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In connection with the Nova Scotia Hospital Units reference
has been made to only a few Nova Scotia nurses. No account of
the humanitarian service of the medical organization in the Great
War should fail to give prominence to the noble work of the
nursing sisters. What they have done to lighten the weary hours
of the wounded, war-sick and homesick soldier has been stamped
indelibly on hundreds of thousands of hearts throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every effort has been made to get a complete list of all the
Nova Scotia nurses who served in the Great War and where they
served. The nearest approach to it is an official list of nurses who
either enlisted or were demobilized in Nova Scotia at the headquarters
of No. 6 Military District. This has been supplemented
by submitting the list, for revision, to some thirty active service
nurses and also a number of Medical Officers. Even now there
will undoubtedly be some omissions and errors.</p>

Miss MacDonald had previously seen active service in the Spanish-American
War and the South African War.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <em>THE CANADIAN ARMY DENTAL CORPS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>That Dental Services are a necessity in the army is one of
the many lessons taught us by the War and it has been amply
proved that the Canadian Army Dental Corps was responsible
for placing at least 10 per cent of the Canadian and
British troops at the Front who, but for the excellent dental services
provided, would not have been there.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_226.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. B. L. NEILLY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Members of the dental profession in
Nova Scotia were among the first to
offer their services, and in August, 1914,
three of them, Drs. B. L. Neilly, F. W.
Bruce Kelly and H. L. Mitchener, were
on duty at Valcartier Camp. Drs. Neilly
and Kelly proceeded Overseas and were
the first dental surgeons at the Front.
So far as can be learned these were the
only dental surgeons with the Canadian
troops at that date, Captain Bentley of
Ontario reporting early in September.</p>

<p class='c007'>For eight years previous to the War
a Committee of the Canadian Dental Association on “Dental
Services in the Army” repeatedly approached the Federal Government
with regard to a definite Army Dental Association to be
administered by the Medical Services or otherwise, but were finally
informed that the organization then existing, which consisted of
twenty-six Dental Officers attached to the Army Medical Corps as
Honorary Captains and Lieutenants, was quite satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the outbreak of the War members of the profession throughout
Canada, realizing the necessity of dental services for recruits,
voluntarily provided dental treatment for thousands of men who,
otherwise, could not have been accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The attention of the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, was
directed to the importance and value of this work by Generals
Fotheringham, Lessard, Loggie and others as well as by a sub-committee
of civilian dentists from Toronto, who proceeded to
Ottawa early in 1915 under the direction of Dr. George Kerr
Thomson of Halifax, Chairman of the Canadian Dental Association’s
Committee on “Dental Services in the Army,” with the
result that the Minister immediately issued orders for a Dental
organization, similar to that of the Medical, but entirely separate.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this action by the Minister is due the fact that Canada was
the first country in the world to organize an Army Dental Corps
separate and distinct from other military organizations. Dr.
Thomson was first recommended by the Toronto Committee and
the dental profession for Director of Dental Services, but Dr.
Armstrong of Ottawa received the appointment, and in June, 1915,
proceeded Overseas with thirty-five officers, thirty-five N.C.O.’s
and thirty-five privates. This organization was increased from
time to time until there were over one thousand Dental Officers and
other ranks on duty Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was realized that while it was necessary to provide dental
services for men Overseas, it was even more important that they
be made dentally fit before sailing; and in October, 1915, the Home
Service organization was authorized with a Director at Ottawa
and an Assistant Director in each Military District together with
a strength of one officer, N.C.O. and private for each 1,000 men.
This necessitated an organization of at least sixty of all ranks in
Military District No. 6, which at that time included New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Members of the dental profession in the three provinces responded
notably to the call of duty, and, while it does not come
within the scope of this history to mention the services of men in
other provinces, it is desirable to put on record great appreciation
of the excellent services rendered by members of the dental profession
in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island who were
on duty in Military District No. 6. One of the most prominent
practitioners in St. John, N.B., Dr. James M. Magee, ex-President
of the Canadian Dental Association and Dominion Dental Council
and a member of the Nova Scotia Dental Association, who, before
the War, was attached as Honorary Captain to the Army Medical
Corps, was one of the first to join the Home Service organization
in Military District No. 6.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>OFFICERS OF THE C.A.D.C., M.D. 6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Major Thomson was appointed A.D.D.S., Military District No.
6, on November 1st, 1915. During his absence at Valcartier Camp
in the summer of 1916, Captain Magee acted as A.D.D.S. in
Military District No. 6 and later was appointed A.D.D.S. of
Military District No. 7 when New Brunswick became a separate
Military District.</p>

<p class='c007'>The C.A.D.C. in Military District No. 6 was administered on
a most economical and business-like basis, and at the Camp Hill
Army Dental Surgery, one of the finest and best equipped in the
world, many thousands of men were made dentally fit, not only
before going Overseas, but also on their return to Canada, when
a great many of them needed extensive restorative dental appliances.</p>

<p class='c007'>For several weeks after the great explosion, which occurred
on December 6, 1917, the Staff of the Camp Hill Dental Surgery
rendered services and co-operated with the medical officers, part
of the dental surgery being used as an operating room for the
eye specialists. Some of the dental officers on duty were
severely but not seriously injured, and during the first thirty-six
hours after the explosion rendered valuable first aid to the
injured, with whom Camp Hill was overcrowded.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1916, at Aldershot Camp, two appendicitis operations were
successfully performed in the Camp Dental Surgery, which was
completed long before the Camp Hospital. These cases would
probably have proved fatal had it not been for the foresight of
the dental Staff in expediting the construction of this dental
surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the efforts of Dean Frank Woodbury arrangements
were carried out by the Dental Faculty of Dalhousie University
for rendering dental services to the men of the navy before the
work was performed by the Dental Corps.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <em>CANADIAN ARMY PAY CORPS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Before the outbreak of the War in 1914 the Canadian Army
Pay Corps had only sufficient Staff to deal with the small
permanent force, of which it was an integral part. When
the Canadian Expeditionary Force was organized, and troops
mobilized for home defence, the C.A.P.C. was called upon to
undergo the same strain and expansion demanded of every branch
of the service. Outside of the army little is known of the responsibilities
suddenly thrust upon this department. It had to deal with
all finances, pay, separation allowance, assigned pay, civilian employees,
tradesmen’s accounts, etc., and, as will be seen by the
statement at the end of this article, No. 6 Detachment stationed at
Halifax alone disbursed $53,357,388.08 between August, 1914, and
July, 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August, 1914, No. 6 Detachment, whose territory at that time
included New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, as well as
Nova Scotia, consisted of the following officers and non-commissioned
officers: Lieut.-Col. S. J. R. Sircom (now retired with
rank of Brigadier-General), Capt. J. L. Regan, Sergt.-Major J.
Turner, Quartermaster Sergt. G. H. Saunders, Staff Sergt. G. T.
Allum, Staff Sergt. C. A. Chew, Staff Sergt. B. A. Spink, Sergt.
E. R. Kelly, Sergt. A. V. Chase, Sergt. W. A. Coyne, Sergt. F. A.
Chew.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Staff was increased until at one time 14 officers and 120
non-commissioned officers and men were employed. Some of these
served in No. 6 Detachment throughout the whole period of the
War. Others were transferred to various Units, went Overseas, or
took their discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Every soldier, from a Tommy to a full-fledged General, will
admit that as far as organization and administration were concerned
the Canadian Army Pay Corps was beyond criticism. As soon as
a man enlisted he received his pay regularly, no matter where he
was—in Canada or in England, in the Field, in hospital or on furlough;
and when he returned to Canada for demobilization the
cheque for balance of pay due was handed to him on the day he
was discharged. In addition to this monies were forwarded to his
dependants on account of Separation Allowance, and assigned pay,
settlement made for clothing and equipment, which he purchased
from stores on repayment, for Victory Bonds which he purchased
during his services, remittances to his friends and other payments.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this entailed an enormous amount of work. Ledger sheets
had to be kept up to date, pay books checked up, remittances looked
after, cheques written, documents made up and sent along with the
soldier from one place to another until he finally returned to
Canada, bearing with him like documents from England. Every
officer, non-commissioned officer and man knows the amount of
detail work which this involved.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>BRIG.-GEN. S. J. R. SIRCOM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the original Staff, Col. S. J. R.
Sircom, affectionately known to the
troops in this district as the “Grand Old
Man,” endeared himself to all ranks
with whom he came in contact by his
urbanity and kindly consideration. Colonel
Sircom commenced his military
career early in life. He joined the Halifax
Garrison Artillery as a 2nd Lieutenant
in 1878, and the 63rd Regiment,
Halifax Rifles, in 1885. He transferred
to the Militia Staff with the rank of
Major in 1905, and on January 1, 1907,
was appointed to the C.A.P.C. with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel,
and became Paymaster of the 6th Divisional area. He was promoted
to the rank of Colonel on May 24, 1916. He proceeded to
London as a representative of the Paymaster-General the latter
part of 1918, and on his return from Overseas was retired to
Pension with the rank of Brigadier-General.</p>

as assistant to Col. W. R. Ward, then Chief Paymaster Canadian
Expeditionary Force. Captain Regan was largely responsible for
the organization of the Canadian Pay Services in France and England.
He was later promoted to the rank of Colonel and appointed
Deputy Paymaster-General. He was awarded the C.M.G., and on
his return to Canada became Director of
Pay Services at Ottawa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quartermaster Sergt. J. Turner
transferred to the Highland Brigade as
Captain and Quartermaster. He was
seriously injured in the Halifax explosion
and is now invalided to Pension.
Staff Sergeant G. T. Allum, now
Sergeant-Major, is retired to Pension.
Quartermaster Sergeant G. H. Saunders
was promoted to the rank of Captain.
Captain Saunders remained with No. 6
Detachment during the whole period of
the War, and the admirable manner in which this Unit met all
demands upon it, particularly during the trying months of demobilization,
was largely due to his energy, efficiency and foresight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Staff Sergts. C. A. Chew and B. A. Spink proceeded Overseas
and both returned with the rank of Captain. The former was discharged
to Pension; the latter is employed at Militia Headquarters.
Staff Sergt. A. V. Chase went Overseas with the Clearing Services
Command and returned with the rank of Captain. He will be
remembered by all returning officers and men who passed through
or had dealings with the Clearing Depot, Halifax, as a very efficient
officer. Sergt. W. A. Coyne proceeded Overseas as Captain Clearing
Services Command and is now struck off strength. Sergt. F. A.
Chew proceeded Overseas with the 25th Battalion, returned as a
Captain in the C.A.P.C., and is now struck off strength to Pension.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. G. C. Sircom, son of Brigadier-General S. J. R. Sircom,
after return from Overseas, was employed in the Pay Office, and
now has a commission in the Permanent Army Pay Corps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. J. A. C. Mowbray, when war was declared, offered
his services and was detailed as Paymaster to the 2nd Brigade,
C.F.A., proceeding Overseas with that Unit. After serving in
France for about one year he was recalled to London to fill
a post in the Pay Office Headquarters. He became Deputy Assistant
Paymaster-General, was awarded the O.B.E., and later was transferred
to Canada to fill his present position,
which is designated as Senior Pay
Officer for Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following are a few of the
officers who did good work in this
Division during the War, either before
proceeding Overseas or returning from
Overseas on demobilization or as Paymasters
of Units:—Major J. Taylor,
Major M. H. Morrison, Major R. H.
Humphrey, Major J. D. Murphy, Major
Colin MacIntosh, Capt. H. Powis

O’Donnell.</p>

<p class='c007'>To show the vast amount of work carried out by this Detachment
the following statement of monthly expenditure is appended.
This does not include disbursements for clothing and equipment,
horses, transports, camp supplies, wagons, etc., but purely pay and
allowance of troops and their upkeep. Considering the amount of
cash handled it is satisfactory to know that not one cent was lost
to the public by misappropriation or otherwise.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <em>THE ROYAL CANADIAN GARRISON ARTILLERY.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Lord Kitchener once remarked—in reply to a question—“The
Front is where a soldier is ordered to be.” In accordance
with this, those men whose duties necessitated their
being retained in connection with the Coast Defences, were made
to abide by the decision of those responsible for the strategy of the
defence of Canadian shores.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the War, the Permanent Force, of which the R.C.G.A.
form a part, are the only persons in uniform; and the imputation of
not being an Overseas Unit is not a good advertisement to attract
recruits. Moreover, the imputation is not only unjust, but untrue,
as the following will show:</p>

<p class='c007'>In July, 1914, relations between the British Empire and the
Central Powers were very strained, and on July 30th, four days
before the War was officially declared, the R.C.G.A. were ordered
to man the most important forts as a precaution, since it is an axiom
in naval warfare that, if possible, a surprise attack is the first and
best declaration of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 5th Fortress Orders contained the following:—“War
having broken out with Germany, the Halifax Defence
Scheme comes into force herewith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 6th August, the 1st Regiment, C.G.A., mobilized and
proceeded to the Forts to complete the manning, since the R.C.G.A.
alone were too few in number completely to man more than the two
largest forts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first portion of the annual training for the year had just
been completed, and one can truthfully say that Halifax was as
well able to repel a raid as any other fortress in the Empire at that
period.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>It was thought by most people in the early days of the War
that the War would last only a few months, and the personnel of
the Defences had to find accommodation where they could, until
well on into the winter; for coast forts in peace time are not
provided with accommodation for lengthy occupation; consequently,
both officers and men had a far from comfortable time until wooden
huts were constructed.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the Artillery Units allotted to the Fortress were for any
length of time up to full strength, so that barely sufficient men were
available to form the necessary reliefs for the guns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Night and day, all through the War, from July 30th, 1914, until
after the signing of the Armistice, November 11, 1919, enough
men to work the guns had to be near them and alert, while on each
gun was a sentry, who was relieved every hour, and whose duty
was to watch seawards for the approach of any hostile craft. Not
a very arduous task at first sight, but enough to make most men long
to be Overseas after a few months of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately the Germans were not very enterprising, and considered
that the presence of the Coast Defences was too great a risk
to run, so that Halifax did not have to go through the horrors of a
bombardment as well as the explosion, though, had the city been
undefended, it would, no doubt, like several English towns, have
received a few shells from time to time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1915, the 3rd Regiment, C.G.A., from St. John, N.B.,
came for training, as St. John was about to be fortified, and a
portion of this Unit was retained to reinforce the Units already
doing duty in the Forts. In April, 1915, No. 4 Company, P.E.I.,
C.G.A., came for training. Some of these men had already been
on duty with heavy field guns at Canso and Sydney. When trained
they remained in Halifax, sending drafts Overseas from time to
time, and proved themselves efficient gunners.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1915, a number of N.C.O.’s and men sailed for the
Front, but all efforts of others to do so were in vain, though
several N.C.O.’s and men took their fate in their own hands and
stowed away on transports conveying infantry. Some of these got
as far as France, but discipline had to be maintained, and all were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>brought back. This incident will show that the men of the R.C.G.A.
did not remain in Halifax from choice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In July, 1916, authority was at last obtained for the R.C.G.A.
to form a Siege Battery, and this was quickly done; in it were
some of the best N.C.O.’s and men in the Corps, and the whole
Battery were of splendid physique. This Battery left for Overseas
in September, 1916, under the command of Major S. A. Heward,
R.C.A. It arrived in France on the 22nd March, 1917, and took
part in many big fights, including Vimy Ridge, Hill 70, Passchendaele,
Cambrai and Mons. Men of a Siege Battery get plenty of
heavy work and little chance of heroic deeds as individuals, but the
Battery has to its credit the following decorations:—Military Cross,
2; Distinguished Conduct Medal, 2; Military Medals, 16; Meritorious
Service Medals, 3; while several other officers from the
R.C.A. in Halifax were awarded the D.S.O. and M.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the Battery left for Overseas, preparations for raising
another were immediately made, and those officers and men
Who were unable to go in the previous one vied with each other to
get a place in this, but it was not authorized, and drafts only were
found as reinforcements to the one already authorized. Moreover,
it was deemed advisable that certain specially trained officers and
men were essential for the efficient working of the Home Defence,
and these could not go, even in drafts, unless they had others to
replace them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It takes some time to make an artilleryman, particularly a
garrison gunner, who is expected to know every type of gun from
a light field piece to the heaviest coast defence gun, or siege
howitzer, all of which form part of the armament of a coast
fortress, so that, although no doubt if the War had lasted long
enough all would eventually have been replaced, these men had to
remain.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of R.C.A. officers went over in charge of drafts of the
R.C.G.A. or other Units.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 1st Regiment, C.G.A., sent over many officers and men in
drafts to infantry units and to an Ammunition Column.</p>

<p class='c007'>The P.E.I. C.G.A. Detachment also formed an Ammunition
Column.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Early in 1915 the British Government decided to re-arm St.
Lucia, and the Units at Halifax, with some additional personnel
from Esquimalt and Quebec, were called upon to furnish men for
this purpose. The first draft went in March, 1915. They had to
mount the guns (some of which were of French pattern and quite
strange to them), and generally organize the defences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the autumn of 1917 and spring of 1918 the enemy submarines
raided the Atlantic coasts of the United States and Canada, and it
was very essential that the important port of Sydney, N.S., should
be more strongly defended, so new guns of heavier calibre were
sent from Halifax and mounted there. This necessitated additional
men, and drafts from Toronto and British Columbia were detailed
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>These men, some of them called under the Military Service Act,
were an exceptionally good type and quickly made efficient
specialists and gunners. Some were sent for training as officers
and would have relieved those officers in the Forts who had been
unable to get away. Unfortunately for them the Armistice was
declared and hostilities ceased, so that this scheme did not
materialize, though some of these men obtained probationers’
certificates.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important branch of the R.C.G.A. in Halifax is the Royal
School of Artillery (Coast Defence and Siege) and this School, the
only Siege Artillery School in Canada, was responsible for the training
of most of the Siege Artillery Officers and Specialists, as well
as several Batteries and Drafts that went Overseas after the First
Contingent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this, a gun practice at Halifax, Sydney and St.
John was carried out under the supervision of the R.S.A. Staff,
while courses for officers and specialists, Coast Defence Artillery,
were also given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The establishment of Instructors was one officer and three other
ranks, but as one N.C.O. Instructor was stationed at St. John, this
was increased by a N.C.O. from the 1st Regiment, C.G.A.
Officers from the C.G.A. were attached as assistants for varying
periods.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1915, the I.G., now Lieut.-Col. W. G. Beeman, D.S.O.,
R.C.A., went Overseas, and in 1916 his successor, Major H. R. N.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Cobbett, R.C.A., went over with No. 9 Siege Battery. In 1918 one
Warrant Officer Instructor was permitted to go; he was immediately
appointed Instructor at the Canadian School of Gunnery,
Witley, England, and it was only with great difficulty that he
managed to reach France, where he again was utilized as an
Instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of the Staff felt most keenly the fact that they had to
be retained in Canada, as their position after the War, when dealing
with classes who had seen Overseas service, would not be at all
enviable. It was very unfortunate that arrangements had not been
made to replace them, so that they might go to the Front even for a
short time, because although it is a fact that good teachers are born,
not made, there is a tendency to think that anyone with long
experience in the fighting line must be a good instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Officers from all parts of Canada took courses at the R.S.A.,
and it speaks well for the training which they received that on reaching
England further training, other than three weeks’ at Lydd, was
considered unnecessary in most cases, and at Lydd these officers
usually took first place in the examinations held there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of them, who were unable to get positions in the C.E.F.,
were given commissions in the British Artillery, and in several cases
commanded Batteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owing to the smallness of Staff and limited demand for siege
artillery the actual numbers trained were not as large as those in
other Artillery Schools, but with small classes the training was
naturally very thorough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Units trained may be mentioned:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Altogether about 80 officers and 1,500 N.C.O.’s and men of the
Artillery Units (including 10th Siege Battery) stationed in Halifax
were sent Overseas, and the majority of those mobilized in 1914
who did not go were unable to do so either through being specialists,
over age or low category.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it is realized that these Corps had great difficulty in
obtaining recruits, owing to the fear that men would be retained for
Home Service, the numbers shown are considered very creditable.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <em>THE CANADIAN ENGINEERS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The Corps of Canadian Engineers has no local connection
with any Province in the same way that Infantry Regiments
and Battalions have. At the end of the War in France it
consisted of some twelve Battalions, together with other small
Engineering Units with Administrative Staffs, etc., which Units
were recruited from all parts of Canada, and no particular Engineering
Unit was sent from the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many individual officers and men were sent to the
Engineers from this Province, and did very excellent work, but
were posted to various Overseas Units, hence the impossibility of
describing particularly the work and services of Nova Scotia
Sappers.</p>

<p class='c007'>As far as service in Canada is concerned the defence of the
Fortress of Halifax was a very important matter, and the services
of a very large number of officers and other ranks of the R.C.E.
Permanent Force and Canadian Engineers, Active Militia, were
employed at this Fortress throughout the War. Their strenuous
duties and long hours in connection with the continual operation of
electric lights and maintenance of fortifications were carried out
untiringly and most conscientiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Practically every officer and other rank in these two Corps not
only volunteered for Overseas service, but also took very strenuous
measures to get to France, by hook or by crook, and a great many
of them were successful. Others unfortunately were retained in
Halifax for the defence of that Fortress.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <em>MILITIA UNITS ON HOME SERVICE.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The following memorandum was prepared to bring to the
attention of the Minister of Militia and Militia Council some
facts and figures respecting the services of the Militia of
Canada <em>in Canada</em>, and particularly the Fortress of Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and the Atlantic Seaboard, who although they repeatedly
volunteered for Overseas were not allowed to go because their
duties were held to be supremely important by those in authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>1st—Halifax has always been a Military and Naval Station of
the Empire, and confidential instructions have always been in existence
and a comprehensive scheme of defence in the hands of
officers commanding Units, to be put in force immediately on
declaration of war. Therefore, the following Halifax Fortress
Order was issued by the G.O.C. M.D. No. 6, August 5, 1914:</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 681. “War having broken out with Germany the Halifax
defence scheme comes into effect forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with this order all Halifax Units were immediately
mobilized and remained on duty in defence of Halifax
practically for the duration of the War. The 94th Regiment was
also mobilized for the defence of the Canso cable station, Cape
Breton wireless station, etc., and other detachments were placed on
active service at various points in the district.</p>

<p class='c007'>2nd—The importance of Halifax as a Military and Naval Station
in British North America in the eyes of the Imperial and
Canadian authorities is borne out by the following facts:</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>a</em>) The immense amount of money spent in fortifications.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>b</em>) The inauguration of an examination service, whereby all vessels
were examined before being allowed to enter the harbor.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>c</em>) Halifax was the examination port for North America, and at
times there were upwards of 200 large ocean-going vessels lying at
anchor in the harbor.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>(<em>d</em>) The manning of the Port War Signal Station, by which all
British and Allied warships were passed in under secret signals and
codes.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>e</em>) All guns in the various forts were kept loaded, and the crews
were kept standing by day and night, ready for instant action.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>f</em>) The infantry continually patrolled the coast, guarding the
approaches to the city, and protecting cable landings and wireless stations.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>g</em>) When orders were issued to reduce the strength of the defences
in September, 1914, the British Admiral on the Station informed Headquarters
that if this order were carried out he would withdraw his fleet
and mine the harbor, which would mean closing the harbor to all
shipping.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>h</em>) A Hydroplane Station was established, and patrolled the coast
daily during the latter part of the War.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>i</em>) Owing to the protection afforded by the defences of Halifax, the
authorities were enabled to dispatch from this port in the vicinity of
300,000 Canadian troops, in addition to many thousand Colonial and
Allied troops, including Australians, New Zealanders, Bermudians, Fiji
Islanders, Americans, and some 50,000 Chinese labor troops.</p>

<p class='c019'>(<em>j</em>) By means of its defence Halifax afforded shelter for a large
number of merchant vessels that were driven in by German raiders
early in the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should also be noted that submarines were frequently in the
vicinity of the harbor, and on one notable occasion a large oil tanker
was sunk two hours after she left her pier, and several fishing
vessels were sunk off the coast, and other large transports and cargo
vessels were driven ashore at the entrance of the harbor. The
transport <em>City of Vienna</em> became a total wreck. Preparations were
made and orders issued to provide against possible landing parties
from German raiders. Stringent orders were issued providing for
the screening of all lights in the city and prosecutions were issued
for neglecting to carry out this order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing is enumerated with the object of showing the
importance of Halifax Harbor as a War Station and the necessity
of having it properly defended by maintaining the Garrison at full
strength.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <em>THE FIRST REGIMENT CANADIAN GARRISON ARTILLERY.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This Unit was organized in 1869 for the purpose of assisting
the Regular Forces of the Garrison of Halifax in manning
the Forts. The Regiment has always been at a high state of
efficiency, due to the superior class of men it has been able to attract
to its ranks.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_245.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. A. W. DUFFUS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From the date of its organization the Regiment has been commanded
by many prominent citizens.
The following is the list in order of
service: Lieut.-Col. A. G. Jones (late
Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia),
Lieut.-Col. Wm. Creighton, Lieut.-Col.
George Mitchell, Lieut.-Col. Thomas
Mowbray, Lieut.-Col. A. E. Curren,
Lieut.-Col. F. H. Oxley, Lieut.-Col. A.
G. Hesslein, Lieut.-Col. H. Flowers,
and, in 1914, at the outbreak of war, by
Lieut.-Col. J. A. Marshall, followed at
the completion of his term of service
by Lieut.-Col. A. W. Duffus, who commanded up to the cessation
of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 3, 1914, Capts. A. N. Jones, S. C. Oland, and George
Brew were detailed for duty at the examination Battery. On
August 4th the Commanding Officer received orders to mobilize,
and on August 6th the Regiment was detailed to and occupied its
various posts in the Batteries of the Fortress of Halifax. All
officers and men in the city reported for duty: those absent were
summoned by wire and letter, and joined the Unit within a few
days.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The following officers remained with the Unit during the War,
but did not proceed Overseas, because the Department at Ottawa
claimed their services could not be dispensed with:</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. J. A. Marshall, Lieut.-Col. A. W. Duffus, Major A.
M. Bauld (Q.M.), Capts. J. M. Allen (Adjt.), W. C. Bauld (P.M.),
L. J. Donaldson (Chaplain), Major H. E. Gates, Major P. O.
Soulis (transferred to H.Q. M.D. No. 6), Capts. C. Churchill,
A. F. Haliburton, L. L. Harrison, Lieuts. O. A. M. Wilson, G. B.
Isnor, W. J. O’Connell, J. E. Rutledge, A. H. Thomson, Leo Esther,
G. W. Carmichael, W. E. Forsythe, C. R. Hoben, H. C. Frame,
P. L. Whitman, D. A. Forsythe, R. M. Fielding, F. A. Grant, W. E.
Stewart, E. K. Fielding, H. H. Miller, W. Mitchell, A. J. Haliburton,
C. H. Crosby, F. S. Thomson.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Department of Militia and Defence at first ruled that no
officer or man of the Fortress could proceed Overseas, as his services
were required here and he could not be spared. Later on this
ruling was somewhat modified and officers and men were relieved
as soon as they could be replaced by new men and permitted to join
various Units. Many, however, were not accorded this privilege,
much to their chagrin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six hundred and twenty-five men and the following officers were
permitted to go Overseas at various times and with various Units
and branches of the service, taking any chance that offered rather
than remain at home:</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. E. V. Hogan, Major G. H. Maxwell, Major J. L.
MacKinnon (now Lieut.-Colonel), Major A. N. Jones, Capts. L. N.
Seaman, E. L. Miller, S. C. Oland, G. M. Brew, F. S. Burns, G. B.
Oland, G. A. Medcalf, P. B. Stairs, Lieuts. J. R. Curry, W. M. Ray,
F. B. Sharp, G. A. Gaherty, R. W. Churchill, D. J. Maxwell, E. P.

F. M. Blackett, R G. McAloney, W. R. Harris, M. B. Archibald,
H. B. Bell, T. H. Whelpley, O. R. Crowell.</p>

<p class='c007'>And from the Reserve of Officers, Lieut.-Col. H. Flowers and
Major Allister Fraser, M.C. Of these Major G. H. Maxwell,
Capt. Philip B. Stairs, Lieuts. E. G. Dickie and R. G. MacAloney
made the supreme sacrifice.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>OFFICERS OF THE 1ST REGIMENT, C.G.A.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>It is impossible to give a list of the many non-commissioned
officers and men who were a credit to their Regiment on the fields
of Flanders. Their records appear with the records of the Units
in which they served.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is supposed by many that the troops of the Garrison lived in
comparative luxury, whereas the contrary was the case. Many
hardships were undergone and, apart from the fact that the Hun
raiders gave Halifax a wide berth, knowing that an attack would
mean a waste of ammunition, which could not be replaced this side
of Zeebrugge, conditions generally were often not so good as in
France, owing to the severity of our climate. The casements in
which the men were supposed to be quartered in time of war were
entirely unfit for occupation as, owing to long disuse, they were in
a very damp and unsanitary condition. The Unit was, therefore,
placed under canvas, and it was late in December before any
attempt was made to provide proper and suitable winter quarters.
Owing to a fine distinction made between the Militia and Overseas
forces, which only an army man can understand, the men were not
provided with a full kit, even boots being denied them until many
of them were actually barefoot. Underclothing and other necessaries
had to be purchased by the men themselves, until at last the
responsible authorities awakened to the fact that there was a real
war on.</p>

<p class='c007'>About August 16, 1914, the first Canadian Contingent commenced
mobilizing at Valcartier, and orders were received calling
for volunteers from the Garrison. The 1st C.A. were to provide
one officer and twenty-five other ranks. Capt. George M. Brew
proceeded to Valcartier with the draft, and on arrival was told he
was not wanted and ordered to return to Halifax. This officer was
so disappointed that he resigned his commission and travelled to
England at his own expense, where he joined a Unit of the Imperial
artillery and served with it during the greater part of the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>In September, 1914, it was considered unnecessary to keep the
Units on garrison duty at full strength, and a reduction was proposed.
The naval authorities, however, insisted that a fully garrisoned
fortress was necessary as a protection for the Naval Base,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and no reduction was made. Later on the artillery forces were
increased. All of which shows the importance placed on the
Fortress by the Imperial authorities during war time.</p>

<p class='c007'>From time to time the Commanding Officer offered the services
of the Unit for Overseas, and asked permission to form Batteries
of heavy and field artillery, but without result. Small detachments
were allowed to volunteer as emergencies arose, such as artillery
Units being short of men, on account of casualties occurring, while
passing through Halifax, and then only on condition that men were
found to replace them. It was not until 1917 that permission was
given to form an ammunition column, and immediately on its completion
a second one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much might be written of happenings during the war period
which, while of interest to the officers, non-commissioned officers
and men, were all in the day’s work and of no historical value. It
is sufficient to say that this Unit with the other Units of the Garrison
performed their duties well and satisfactorily.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <em>THE 11th BRIGADE, C.F.A., AND COMPOSITE ARTILLERY COMPANY.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 11th Brigade was the junior Artillery Brigade of the
6th Military District. It comprised in addition to the
Headquarters Staff, the 27th (Digby) Battery, the 28th
(Pictou) Battery and the 29th (Yarmouth) Battery. Although
the Brigade was not ordered out on active service, it contributed
possibly more than its original strength in personnel to the prosecution
of the Great War. Almost the first day of the War the
Commanding Officer (Lieut.-Col. T. M. Seeley, of Yarmouth,
N.S.) wired the offer of services to headquarters and the Battery
officers busied themselves with looking to the details of organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. F. W. Pickles, O.C. 29th Battery (Yarmouth), joined the
17th Battery of Sydney, one of the first Units on the march, with
a detachment of eighteen non-commissioned officers and men from
his Battery. Subsequently every artillery Unit and many of the
Infantry Battalions had on their strength representatives of the
11th Brigade. This was made possible largely by the untiring
efforts of a few senior officers, who for some good reason or other,
were unable to proceed Overseas. Prominent among these were
Majors H. S. Hamilton, of Pictou; D. C. McKay, of Digby, and
A. K. Van Horne, of Yarmouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The services of the officers of the 11th Brigade, summarily put,
were: Lieut.-Col. T. M. Seeley, O.C., was successful in organizing
the 23rd Battery, C.E.F.; a Company for guard duty at Barrington
Passage, Radio Station, and a Company in the 112th Battalion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>C.E.F., under Colonel Tremaine, with which the latter crossed the
Atlantic. Capt. A. A. Durkee, Adjutant of the Brigade, organized
at Valcartier the first Ammunition Unit in the C.E.F., and proceeded
Overseas with the First Contingent. He was early at the
Front, and was promoted to Major and Lieut.-Colonel, and commanded,
in turn, a Brigade Ammunition Column, a Battery, and a
Brigade of Artillery. He was mentioned in dispatches and was
awarded the D.S.O. Lieut.-Col. Durkee is also a South African
War veteran. Capt. V. F. Connor, C.A.M.C., was on duty through
the greater part of the War, and rendered valuable service at the
time of the great explosion in Halifax, December, 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 27th Battery contributed to the C.E.F. Capt. Glidden
Campbell, of Weymouth, who went over with the 85th Battalion,
and who was awarded the M.C.; Lieuts. C. D. Shreve, M.C., killed
in action in the artillery; K. V. Schurman and H. A. Marshall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 28th Battery had to its credit in the C.E.F., Major J. K.
McKay, of Pictou, who went over in command of the 23rd Battery,
C.E.F. He commanded a Battery and a Brigade of Artillery
at the Front, being latterly promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel.
He was severely wounded and received the D.S.O. From the 28th,
Lieuts. C. E. Churchill, H. P. MacKeen, J. E. Read, J. D. Hickman,
H. P. MacKenzie, and possibly others, entered the C.E.F. Capt.
V. C. Johnson, Corps Reserve, was Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 29th Battery furnished (in addition to Adjutant Durkee,
already mentioned) Capt. F. W. Pickles, who commanded a section
of a Divisional Ammunition Column at the Front; Lieut. Ralph
P. Harding, who rose to the command of a Battery, with the
rank of Major, and returned with the M.C. and the D.S.O.; Lieuts.
W. Arthur Porter, G. St. C. A. Perrin, E. J. Vickery, G. O. Rogers,
E. J. Stekelin, who became Major; H. E. Crowell, who became
Major; S. C. Hood, Jr., who became Captain, and M. B. Davis.
The 29th Battery claims the honor of having had in its membership
at one time Brig.-General W. O. H. Dodds, C.M.G., D.S.O., now of
Montreal.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>In April, 1915, detachments from the 27th Battery (Digby) and
the 29th Battery (Yarmouth) and No. 1 Siege Company
(Mahone), were assembled at Yarmouth, under Lieut.-Col.
T. M. Seeley, for preliminary training, and in May following proceeded
to Barrington Passage for guard duty at the Radio Station.
Among their duties was the construction of a road three miles long
through a very difficult country. Practically the whole strength of
this Company transferred to Overseas Units. Officers, in addition
to the O.C: Capt. W. T. Ernst, and Lieut. C. Melvin.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <em>THE 63rd REGIMENT HALIFAX RIFLES.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The 63rd Regiment, Halifax Rifles, was first organized as a
Regiment in 1860, under the title of “The Halifax Volunteer
Battalion.” The Volunteer Companies which then
composed the Regiment had previously been acting as independent
bodies. The first Colonel was Sir Willian Fenwick Williams, of
Kars, and on March 16, 1860, Capt. William Chearnley (late of
H.M. 8th King’s Regiment of Foot), who was in command of the
Chebucto Greys, was by an order from Adjutant-General’s Office
appointed Captain Commanding the Halifax Volunteer Battalion.
This was the official date of the organization of the Unit, better
known as the 63rd Halifax Rifles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Companies comprising the Regiment at its formation were
the Scottish Rifles, Chebucto Greys, Mayflower Rifles, Halifax
Rifles, Irish Rifles, and Dartmouth Rifles. In 1862 the Dartmouth
Engineers joined the Regiment, which mustered seven Companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 10, 1862, the Halifax City Council presented the
Regiment with its first set of colors. The presentation was made
by the wife of the Mayor, Mrs. P. C. Hill. On the same date, Lady
Mulgrave, wife of the Governor of Nova Scotia, in the name of
the ladies of the City of Halifax, presented the Regiment with a
silver bugle, which was to be shot for each year. This bugle is
still in the possession of the Regiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January, 1865, Captain Chearnley was appointed Lieut.-Colonel
and the Battalion reorganized, two of the Companies, the
Irish Rifles and Dartmouth Engineers, disbanding. The Halifax
Rifles, which was double strength, took the place of the Irish Rifles—the
muster now being six Companies. This Regiment had its
first call for service in 1866, doing garrison duty during the alarm
caused by the Fenian Raids into Canada. The service lasted from
June 6th to July 31st.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In 1868 the Regiment was transferred from the Volunteer Force
to the Active Militia, and was officially designated as the Halifax
Volunteer Battalion of Rifles, and on May 13, 1870, the Militia
Department having been regularly organized, the name changed to
the 63rd Battalion of Rifles, and later to 63rd Regiment, Halifax
Rifles, which name it retained up to and during the late Great War.</p>

<p class='c007'>Successive Commanding Officers were as follows: Lieut.-Col.
Chearnley, 1865 to 1871; Lieut.-Col. Andrew MacKinlay, 1871 to
1872; Lieut.-Colonel Pallister, 1872 to 1879; Lieut.-Col. J. W.
Mackintosh, 1879 to 1890; Lieut.-Col. J. D. Walsh, 1890 to 1892;
Lieut.-Col. T. J. Egan, 1892 to 1898; Lieut.-Col. John Crane, 1898
to 1903; Lieut.-Col. J. T. Twining, 1903 to 1908; Lieut.-Col. C. A.
Gunning, 1908 to 1913; Lieut.-Col. I. W. Vidito, 1913 to 1917;
Lieut.-Col. C. A. Mumford, 1917 until demobilized 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 63rd furnished 109 officers and men for service during the
Northwest Rebellion. Major Walsh was in command, with Capts.
Hechler, Cunningham and Fortune and Lieutenants Silver, James,
Twining, McKie, Fletcher and Fiske. Captain Corbin was appointed
Quartermaster of the Provisional Battalion. They entrained
for the West on April 4, 1885, and returned to Halifax and rejoined
their Unit July 24 of the same year. The Regiment also furnished
sixty-one officers, non-commissioned officers and men for service in
the South African War.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the declaration of the Great War, August 4, 1914, the 63rd
Regiment, Halifax Rifles was ordered out for service in defence
of the Fortress of Halifax. One hundred men under the command
of Capt. H. N. Clarke, with Capt. J, W. Logan, Lieut. E. R. Dennis
and Lieut. F. H. M. Jones, proceeded at once to Wellington Barracks,
and the remainder of the Unit was at once mobilized and
proceeded under command to the various war stations assigned to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>By August 5, 1914, the mobilization of the Unit being completed,
the Regiment paraded in full strength under Lieut.-Col. I. W.
Vidito, with Major W. E. Thompson Second in Command, and
Capt. D. R. Turnbull, Adjutant, and proceeded to their new
quarters, Wellington Barracks, where the Composite Company
under Capt. H. N. Clarke was absorbed, the officers and men rejoining
their old Companies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>On August 12th “B” Company proceeded to McNab’s Island
under the command of Capt. C. A. Mumford, with Lieuts. C. N.
Bennett and W. E. Doane. “D” Company, under Capt. H. F.
Adams and Lieut. C. J. Roche, proceeded to York Redoubt. On
August 18th “G” and “H” Companies proceeded to the Eastern
Camp Site, Dartmouth. These two Companies were under the command
of Major W. H. Conrod. “G” Company (Capt. E. A. Vossnack,
Lieuts. G. S. Kinley and G. C. Sircom) occupied York Farm;
“H” Company (Capt. H. N. Clarke and Lieuts. E. C. Phinney
and J. W. Grant) occupied Kuhn’s Farm. On August 25th “D”
Company under Capt. H. F. Adams moved from York Redoubt to
Camperdown, and on the same date “A” Company (Capt. F. C.
Kingdon, Lieut. R. C. McDonald); “C” Company (Capt. H. G.
DeWolfe, Lieut. H. J. Stech) and “F” Company (Capt. J. W.
Logan, Lieuts. G. M. Sylvester and F. H. Jones) moved to McNab’s
Island. “E” Company (Capt. E. K. McKay, Lieuts. O. Vossnack
and E. R. Dennis) moved to Lawlor’s Island. The last four Companies
were under the command of Major W. E. Thompson. On
August 30th headquarters and regimental details moved to McNab’s
Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately on arrival at their stations each Company started
the work of digging trenches, placing wire entanglements, constructing
blockhouses, dugouts, etc. The men were driven at top
speed at this work, officers and men working all day as well as
doing picquet duty at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the early days of the War H.M. ship <em>Suffolk</em>, then
engaged in hunting for the enemy cruiser <em>Karlsruhe</em>, called at
Halifax in urgent need of coal, and was coaled in record time by
the 63rd Regiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 22nd the first Overseas draft was called for and
twenty-four non-commissioned officers and men under command
of Lieuts. A. F. Major and G. L. Stairs, proceeded to Valcartier
Camp. On November 25, 1914, forty-eight non-commissioned
officers and men were transferred to the 25th Battalion, C.E.F.,
which was then being organized, and on December 6th Major W. H.
Conrod, Lieuts. L. N. B. Bullock, G. C. Sircom and J. A. Grant
were transferred to that Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Major W. E. Thompson was called in by Headquarters Military
District No. 6 in December, 1914, to take over the work of Inspector
of Outposts and Detachments throughout the district, with the rank
of Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>On May 20, 1915, Capt. Wm. Taylor, Lieuts. C. J. Roche and
J. A. Watters, with thirty-three other ranks proceeded to Jamaica
on military duty. On August 13, 1915, thirty-six other ranks were
transferred to the 40th Battalion, then in training at Valcartier.
In September, 1915, an Overseas Company was formed to which
officers and men given permission to go Overseas were attached for
training. From this time, all drafts from the 63rd for Overseas
Units were taken from this Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>An Overseas draft of 100 other ranks with Lieuts. W. D.
Simpson, H. D. Hilton and C. D. Llwyd were struck off the
strength of the 63rd Regiment on February 25, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>Major H. F. Adams was appointed Officer Commanding Discharge
Depot, Halifax, from July 1, 1916. A draft of eighty-eight
other ranks under command of Lieuts. H. A. Creighton and Benj.
Taylor embarked for Overseas on July 15, 1916. The Regiment
was inspected by Field-Marshall H.R.H. Duke of Connaught on
August 24, 1916.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 63rd was placed on a four Company basis from November
1, 1917. The Company officers were: “A” Company, Capt. F. C.
Kingdon, Lieuts. J. A. Watters, H. V. Wier, G. W. Churchill,
H. S. Holloway. “B” Company, Capts. H. J. Steck, D. W. Kennedy,
Lieuts. F. A. Taylor, C. S. Innes, H. R. McCaughin, G. R.
Forbes. “C” Company, Capts. E. Ricketts, G. S. Kinley, Lieuts.
T. L. Parkman, J. E. Milsom, C. N. Innes. “D” Company, Capts.
O. F. Vossnack, W. Taylor, Lieuts. E. G. McMinn, W. R. R.
Tayler, H. H. Irwin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut.-Col. I. W. Vidito was transferred to the Reserve of
Officers on July 1, 1917, and was succeeded in the command of the
Regiment by Lieut.-Col. C. A. Mumford. On the morning of
December 6, 1917, five officers and 143 other ranks were detailed for
relief work following the explosion at Halifax. On April 16, 1918,
the 6th Battalion Canadian Garrison Regiment was authorized, and
in May the 63rd Regiment was relieved from duty. The following
named officers were transferred to the 6th Battalion: Lieut.-Col.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>C. A. Mumford, Capts. E. Ricketts, H. J. Steck, E. K. McKay,
G. S. Kinley, Lieuts. H. V. Wier, J. A. Watters, E. G. McMinn,
G. W. Churchill, J. E. Milsom, H. R. McCoughin, G. R. Forbes,
R. J. Colwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The undermentioned officers were transferred to the 1st Nova
Scotia Depot Battalion: Lieuts. H. A. Wilson, W. R. R. Tayler,
H. S. Holloway, Majors A. R. McCleave and H. N. Clarke, Capts.
F. C. Kingdon, J. D. Monoghan and Lieut. T. Parkman were relieved
from active service.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the organization of the First Canadian Contingent the
Regiment volunteered for service Overseas, but much to the disappointment
of all ranks had to continue its allotted duties in the
defence of the Fortress of Halifax. Owing to the heavy demands
on the Ordnance Department for clothing and equipment needed by
troops preparing for embarkation the requirements of troops on
Home Service could not be met until late in 1914, and for some
time clothing was patched with flour sacks or any other material
available, and worn out soles of boots were reinforced with shingles.
In spite of all discouragements the 63rd faithfully performed the
tasks assigned it, and when at last it was permitted to send drafts
Overseas it became the ambition of all ranks to obtain a transfer to
the Overseas Company. Altogether the Regiment supplied 70
officers and 815 other ranks for service at the Front.</p>

<p>LIEUT.-COL. A. KING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Following Great Britain’s declaration of war against
Germany on August 4, 1914, the 66th Regiment, Princess
Louise Fusiliers, immediately paraded at the Halifax
Armories and the same evening sent an advanced party of four
officers and one hundred other ranks in command of Capt. D. S.
Bauld to Wellington Barracks, where the balance of the Unit under
its Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Col.
H. L. Chipman, followed, and established
its headquarters on August 7,
1914. Preparations were immediately
made to place the 66th Regiment on a
war footing, and excitement ran high
because it was felt by all ranks that,
this being one of the oldest Units in the
Province, the 66th Regiment would be
among the first to see real service; but
the fact that it was never sent Overseas
caused in the later years of the War a
feeling of bitter disappointment, particularly
among those who were destined to carry on tame and unattractive
garrison duty throughout the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Halifax Defence Scheme” unfortunately condemned it to
this uninteresting work, and although the Regiment repeatedly
volunteered for service Overseas its requests were ignored. The
defence of Halifax was altogether a thankless task, and the often
repeated assurance that the Regiment was performing the duties
required of it brought little consolation to the officers and men
whose sole ambition was to join their comrades in the Field.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>The personnel of the officers who turned out with the Regiment
at the time of the declaration of war was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c033'>Capts. A. W. Weston, G. W. Murray, J. McFatridge, D. S. Bauld,
H. H. Bligh, R. W. Frost, C. E. Dowden, J. R. Glazbrook; Lieuts.
W. B. Medcalfe, G. W. Stairs, G. H. Liddell, C. A. Fages, J. C.
Stairs, J. R. Simmonds, G. Dwyer, W. C. Borrett, J. H. Crosskill,
B. H. Smith, R. F. Studd, F. H. Marr, F. R. Heuston, D. Stairs,
G. E. Creighton, L. E. VanBuskirk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later two officers reported for duty from the Corps Reserve,
and during the period of the War twenty-five additional officers
were granted commissions in the Regiment. The Regiment at the
outbreak of the War was on an eight Company basis, and it was
not until December 6, 1915, that the double Company system was
adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first move of importance was the sending of a detachment,
on August 11, 1914, of four Companies, B, E, F and G, and the
Regimental Machine Gun Section, all under command of Major
R. B. Simmonds, to Chain and Long Lakes, with instructions to
prepare a system of trenches, blockhouses, etc., and arrange generally
for the defence of Halifax City from any possible attack from
the West. This force was designated the “Chain Lakes Detachment,”
and with interchanges of officers and other ranks remained
on duty at this post until January 15, 1917, when it proceeded to
York Redoubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The headquarters of the Regiment was moved from Wellington
Barracks to York Redoubt on August 29, 1914, and remained there
until the demobilization of the Unit on May 1, 1918. In January,
1915, Lieut.-Colonel Chipman was seconded from the Regiment and
took over command of the Composite Battalion, which had been
organized for garrison duty, and Lieut.-Col. A. King was gazetted
O.C. 66th Regiment, and continued so until the Unit was relieved
from active service in May, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>About December 1, 1915, authority was granted for the Regiment
to organize a reinforcing draft, five officers and two hundred
and fifty other ranks. The South Barracks on Sackville Street
were immediately taken over, and recruiting and organization work
in connection with the draft was proceeded with. The draft finally
sailed for England on January 22, 1916. This draft was commanded
by Capt. R. F. Studd, the other officers accompanying it
being Lieuts. T. F. Morrison, W. K. Fraser, L. J. Atkinson, and
W. S. Fielding.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the War the 66th Regiment was inspected by His Royal
Highness the Duke of Connaught, His Excellency the Duke of
Devonshire, Major-General Gwatkin, Chief of the Canadian General
Staff, Major-General Lessard, Inspector-General of Eastern Canada,
and by many other distinguished soldiers, and was at all times
most highly complimented on its excellent state of efficiency.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LIEUT.-COL. R. B. SIMMONDS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This Unit played a prominent part in the relief work following
the great explosion of December 6, 1917, which devastated a large
portion of the City of Halifax, caused the loss of some seventeen
hundred lives and entailed untold suffering among so many families
for months following. Lieut.-Col. R. B.
Simmonds was in command of all military
and naval relief parties engaged in rescue
work in the devastated area, and later was
placed in charge of a committee to procure
relief for dependants of all men who
were serving at home or Overseas. It
was the duty of this committee to find
food, clothing and shelter for the families
of all soldiers who had suffered in the
explosion. A large number of mechanics
were placed under the direction of this
committee and the work of relief
practically completed by May 1, 1918. That the duties of this committee
were all carried out it might be mentioned that it effected
practically permanent repairs to over one hundred and sixty houses,
besides looking after the needs of many suffering families, for
which it was complimented by the Minister of Militia and received
the thanks of the Halifax Relief Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Notwithstanding that the Regiment was kept in Canada, it was,
nevertheless, called upon to perform various and arduous duties at
all times. That the Regiment also assisted in a very tangible way
in winning the War is proved by the fact that the 66th Regiment,
Princess Louise Fusiliers sent fifty-four officers and eight hundred
and fifty men to swell the ranks of various Overseas Units of the
Canadian Expeditionary Force, a large number of whom are now
sleeping their last sleep in the fields of Flanders, having upheld the
honor of their Regiment and proved their belief in its motto,
“Fideliter.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <em>94th VICTORIA REGIMENT, ARGYLL HIGHLANDERS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Much has been written of what was done by Canadian Units
in France and Belgium, but little has been said of the Units
compelled to remain on home service, which had to content
themselves with performing garrison duties and supplying reinforcements
to the army in the Field.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 94th Victoria Regiment, Argyll Highlanders, with Headquarters
at Baddeck, Cape Breton, was at the commencement of
hostilities perhaps the most distinctively Highland Battalion in the
forces of the Empire, inasmuch as the Gaelic language was the
mother tongue of eighty per cent. of its personnel. As a rural
Battalion it is recognized as having sent more officers and men
Overseas than any other similar Unit in Eastern Canada. All its
original members, excepting those over age or physically unfit, were
transferred to C.E.F. Units; many of them paid the supreme
sacrifice, and a number of them were decorated for distinguished
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9.30 a.m., August 4, 1914, the Officer Commanding the
Battalion, Lieut.-Col. J. D. McRae, received mobilization orders.
The marching-out strength, including the Canso detachment, was
377 all ranks. The eight Companies were commanded by the
officers, and proceeded to their different stations, on the dates named

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>From a total of 344 other ranks who came out with the Battalion
at the commencement of the War, 311 volunteered for service Overseas.
It took time to train a sufficient number of recruits to replace
these men, but within six months all had been transferred to C.E.F.
Units and were on their way to France. Altogether the Battalion
during its period of service sent 3,632 men to the Front, and it was
a difficult matter at all times to retain a sufficient number of men
to perform the necessary duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eight Companies of the Battalion were called upon to perform
Garrison Guard and Outpost duties at important shipping
points, wireless and cable stations, not only in Cape Breton but also
at Canso. For defence purposes the troops at Marconi Towers,
Glace Bay, Louisburg and Canso erected blockhouses and wire
entanglements, built redoubts and dug trenches, in addition to
carrying into effect a syllabus of training designed better to fit the
men for their more strenuous work with the Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was demobilized June 29, 1918, and the following
officers were transferred to “F” Company, 6th Battalion,

  <h3 class='c012'><em>94th VICTORIA REGIMENT, ARGYLL HIGHLANDERS</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Under the reorganization scheme of the Canadian Militia the
94th Regiment is wiped off the slate and is succeeded by the 1st
Battalion, Cape Breton Highlanders (85th Battalion, C.E.F.). The
officers, N.C.O.’s and men of the old Regiment, who served in it for
years before the fateful summer of 1914, cannot view its passing
without a certain measure of sadness and regret. The spirit of
comradeship that existed among all ranks encouraged them to carry
on through many difficulties in years of peace and enabled them at
a few hours’ notice to proceed in full strength to their allotted
stations, on the declaration of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inspired by the Regiment’s ancient motto, “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Dileas d’on
Bhrataich</span>” (“True to the Flag”), every man who was physically
fit, and many who were not, volunteered for service Overseas.
They did their duty nobly and gave their country a full and overflowing
measure of splendid service. The memory of our comrades
whose mortal remains sleep in the stricken fields of France and
Flanders will be held in affectionate recollection as long as life lasts.
Of them the soldier poet of Nova Scotia, Dr. J. D. Logan, a sergeant
of the 85th Battalion, who served with many officers and men
transferred to that Unit from the 94th, writes:</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The Composite Battalion was formed at Halifax from Companies
drawn from the Militia Regiments of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island to replace the
Royal Canadian Regiment, which was transferred to Bermuda
shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p>LIEUT.-COL. H. L. CHIPMAN.</p>

<p class='c007'>Companies consisting of three officers and fifty-six other ranks
were supplied by the 67th, 69th, 71st,
74th, 75th, 76th, 82nd and 93rd Regiments,
and arrived at Halifax on September
8th and 9th, 1914, taking over at
once garrison duties from the 66th Regiment,
P.L.F., which proceeded to York
Redoubt for outpost duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following guards were furnished:
Quarter Guard, Wellington Barracks;
Gun Wharf; King’s Wharf; Lumber
Yard; Station Hospital; Grain Elevator;
North Ordnance; Dry Dock; Richmond
Pier and Rockhead Hospital. Weekly
Guards were also mounted at Fort Clarence, Fort Cambridge, Fort
Ogilvie and Point Pleasant Battery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion was commanded by Lieut.-Col. A. E. Carpenter,
R.C.R., with Capt. M. E. Roscoe as Adjutant:</p>

<p class='c007'>The Company officers were:—“A” Company (67th Regiment)—Capt.

S. S. Wetmore, 55th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. J. A. Sproul, resigned;
Lieut. M. P. Gillis, 112th Battalion, C.E.F. “E” Company
(75th Regiment)—Capt. W. L. Whitford, 25th Battalion, C.E.F.;
Capt. A. Berringer, resigned; Lieut. C. C. Morash, 112th Battalion,
C.E.F. “F” Company (76th Regiment)—Capt. H. Dickie, resigned
and replaced by Capt. W. H. J. Moxsom, 106th Battalion, C.E.F.;
Lieut. O. G. Heard, 106th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. C. Major, 40th
Battalion, C.E.F. “G” Company (82nd Regiment)—Major F.
Boulter, later transferred to 105th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. A.
McLeod, 105th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. G. E. Full, 40th Battalion,
C.E.F. “H” Company (93rd Regiment)—Major G. R. Oulton;
Capt. J. N. McDonald, 106th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. D. Anderson.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the duties already enumerated, Guard was
mounted over prisoners of war at the Citadel and at the Detention
Barracks, Melville Island. The prisoners were German officers
and men captured on the high seas, with a sprinkling of civilians,
some of whom were found on captured ships; others were residents
of Canada whom it was found necessary to intern.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1915, the Interment Station at Amherst was opened,
and two and one-half Companies under command of Major G. R.
Oulton, with Capt. J. N. McDonald, Lieuts. Davidson and Sproul,
were sent there, and were replaced by one Company from each of
the following Regiments:—78th Regiment—Capt. J. A. McKenzie,
later transferred to 85th Battalion, C.E.F.; Capt. J. R. Maxwell,
106th Battalion, C.E.F. 81st Regiment—Capt. E. S. Doering;
Lieut. J. H. Wallace, 64th Battalion, C.E.F., killed in action; Lieut.
W. W. Slack, 40th Battalion, C.E.F. 93rd Regiment—Capt. J. A.
McPherson, 106th Battalion, C.E.F.; Lieut. P. Boucher, 165th
Battalion, C.E.F.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut. E. W. Joy reported for duty to replace Lieut. C. S. Major,
transferred to 40th Battalion, and assumed the duties of Fortress
Intelligence Officer. Other officers on duty were Major F. S.
Heffernan (93rd), Quartermaster; Lieut. Keith Rogers (C.S.C.),
Signalling Officer; and Lieut. R. Innes (81st), Musketry Instructor,
afterwards O.C. 106th Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Previous to July, 1916, each Company Commander had his own
account with the District Paymaster and was responsible for all payments
to his officers and men. When the Battalion was recognized
as a Unit it was allowed a Paymaster. Capt. H. B. Verge received
the appointment and retained it until transferred to the Nova Scotia
Forestry Battalion in June, 1917, when Capt. W. S. Brignell took
over his duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Battalion suffered considerably in the explosion of December
6, 1917, losing six men killed and 87 per cent. of the N.C.O.’s and
men injured. One officer and two N.C.O.’s died in hospital from
injuries received. The more serious injuries were received by men
on guard at Richmond Pier, North Ordnance and Dry Dock. All
the men killed, excepting one, who was killed in the barrack room,
were members of these Guards. A snowstorm with high wind
which raged for thirty-six hours after the explosion made the
barracks almost untenable, as windows and doors were gone and no
fires could be laid until the chimneys were inspected. The morale
of the men was good during this period. Many N.C.O.’s and men
had their families living near the barracks, a large number of whom
were killed and injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first draft of one hundred men from the Composite
Battalion was sent Overseas in January, 1916, under command of
Lieuts. W. S. Brown and O. Thorne. A second draft of fifty-six
men, under command of Lieut. W. R. Clark, sailed on June 26,
1916. A number of men were transferred to the R.C.R. Base
Depot from time to time and were included in Overseas drafts sent
by that Unit.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Military Service Act came in force in 1918, 125
men in the Composite Battalion, who came under its provisions,
were sent Overseas. The remainder were transferred to the 6th
Battalion, Canadian Garrison Regiment. All the senior officers
were transferred to their Militia Units, with the exception of Major
J. E. Morse, who was transferred to the 6th Battalion, C.G.R.
The junior officers were transferred to the Depot Battalion, 1st
Nova Scotia Regiment, excepting Lieut. W. H. Whidden and Lieut.
I. C. Banks, who were taken on the strength of No. 6 District
Depot and appointed respectively O.C. Casualty Company and Discharge
Section.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>The following officers were on duty when the Unit was disbanded:—Lieut.-Col.
H. L. Chipman, Officer Commanding; Major
G. R. Oulton, Second in Command; Major E. K. Eaton, R.C.R.,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This Unit was authorized on September 25, 1917, for the
purpose of looking after the draftees under the Military
Service Act. Lieut.-Col. H. Flowers, formerly of the 64th
and 25th Battalions, C.E.F., was appointed to command, with
Lieut.-Col. D. S. Bauld, 25th, Second in Command. The original
officers of this Unit were all officers with
service at the Front in France, invalided
home, and unable to return on account of
various disabilities. It was due to this
experience that they were able to handle
this Unit, which eventually reached the
proportions of a Brigade with credit to the
Province of Nova Scotia and themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strength of a Battalion is roughly
1,000 all ranks, and at times the strength

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>From time to time new officers who had not seen Overseas
service were attached, and these were sent Overseas with drafts as
soon as they could be gotten ready.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real work of the Unit commenced about February 1, 1918,
because quarters for mobilization were not available earlier, on
account of the destruction of property caused by the Halifax explosion
in December, 1917. The work was carried on at the Armories,
Halifax, under most trying conditions. “A” Company was
quartered at Charlottetown to take care of the Prince Edward Island
draftees, and remained there doing this work until demobilized.
“B” Company was moved to Amherst early in March, 1918, remaining
there until May 16th, when it joined the Battalion at
Aldershot, Nova Scotia, the Companies in barracks at Halifax
having moved to Aldershot on May 13th.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that date the work of the Unit was extremely strenuous.
Draftees were ordered in at the rate of 250 daily, and the Camp
soon assumed the appearance of a Brigade. The men were medically
examined, inoculated, vaccinated, and their dental troubles
administered to. They were clothed, trained, and when they had
become sufficiently expert to form fours, were equipped and sent
to England to complete the training so well begun here.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Unit dealt with all men coming under the Military Service
Act, who were either ordered to report or were arrested for some
default under the Act, and in this way about 14,000 men passed
through the files of the Unit. Of course, there was considerable
shrinkage, because many did not come up to the necessary physical
standard, and because others became casualties. In all some 5,000
recruits were sent Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest draft was one of 1,700. This draft paraded at
8 p.m. on August 3, 1918; the roll was called, documents checked,
etc. The men were then dismissed and ordered to parade and
entrain at 4.30 a.m. on August 4th. Every man of the 1,700 answered
the roll call but one. He was late for parade but in time to
entrain. His excuse was that he had been married after being
dismissed the night previous. Under the circumstances the O.C.
forgave his tardiness. This was the last draft to be sent. The
War in Europe began to take on a more cheerful aspect; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>farmers and fishermen were required for harvesting, etc., and some
leave was given.</p>

<p class='c007'>In September the Unit moved back to the Halifax Common for
winter quarters. November 11th the Armistice was signed, and
almost immediately the welcome order to demobilize was received.
By March, 1919, all the affairs of the Unit were a matter of history.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br /> <em>“B” UNIT, M.H.C.C.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In the spring of 1915, when the casualties of the Canadian Overseas
Forces commenced returning to Canada, the best methods
of dealing with them had to be considered. The first men to
return were not for medical treatment. They were dealt with by
the Discharge Depots at Halifax and Quebec. At these points the
men received their discharge from the army, their tickets to their
homes, a suit of civilian clothes, and the balance of pay due to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the fall of 1915 the sick and wounded commenced
returning, at first in small numbers; and they were also dealt with
by the Discharge Depots. Those not requiring further medical
treatment were discharged and sent to their homes, with three
months’ pay, paid in three monthly instalments. Those who required
further medical treatment were also discharged, but were
sent to the Convalescent Home nearest to their homes. These Convalescent
Homes were small, and most of them were placed at the
disposal of the Government by private individuals. They were all
equipped by the Red Cross, I.O.D.E., and other local societies
organized throughout Canada by the women of Canada. In the
autumn of 1915 the Military Hospitals Commission was created,
with authority to accept and administer these Homes. The powers
of this Commission were almost unlimited as to their control,
administration, and creation of Hospitals and Convalescent Homes
for the treatment of Canada’s troops returning from Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the spring of 1916 the sick and wounded returned in great
numbers, and the Military Hospitals Commission having foreseen
this, was well prepared to receive them, having provided large
Hospital and Convalescent Home accommodation throughout
Canada from coast to coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question now before the Government was how were the
men to be kept under discipline in these Hospitals and Convalescent
Homes when the men were no longer soldiers, having received their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>discharge from the army when passing through the Discharge
Depots at ports of arrival. It was finally decided that those who
required further medical treatment would not receive their discharge
on arrival, but would be forwarded to the Hospital
or Convalescent Home nearest to their homes and these men
would receive their discharge from the army when their medical
treatment was brought to a finality.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>MAJOR J. F. TAYLOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To take charge of the administration
and discipline of these men, in the
various Hospitals and Homes throughout
the country, the Military Hospitals
Commission Command was created in
June, 1916, “B” Unit being the Unit
charged with the administration of the
Hospitals and Homes throughout the
Maritime Provinces. The Officer Commanding
this Unit during the whole
period of its existence—two years—was
Major J. F. Taylor, of Halifax, an
officer who had done excellent service in
the Pay Branch, and who was selected to command the Maritime
Province Unit on account of his tact and business knowledge.
Major Taylor organized and administered the affairs of “B” Unit
in a highly efficient manner at all times, showing great sympathy
to the men under his command. Owing to his great tact and
business ability, the Unit was second to none in Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duties performed by “B” Unit were manifold. Military
discipline was adopted to a certain extent in all M.H.C.C. Institutions,
but had to be administered with regard to circumstances.
The officers saw only the aftermath of the terrible cataclysm
enacted “over there,” and their hearts were absorbed in the work
of repairing broken humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personnel of the Staff of “B” Unit on March 1, 1917, was
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>On November 1, 1917, Capt. C. M. Mosher resigned as Adjutant
and Capt. Walter Whitford was appointed to that office and carried
on until “B” Unit was dissolved. In November, 1917, Capt. H. C.
Sircom, a returned officer, was appointed Paymaster to succeed
Capt. Peachy, who had been transferred to the Discharge Depot
Command.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hospitals and Convalescent Homes that were turned over to
“B” Unit by the Military Hospital Commission consisted of the

<p class='c007'>Ross Military Convalescent Home was presented to the

on June 1, 1915.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>CAPT. WALTER WHITFORD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The personnel in each of these Hospitals were transferred to
the M.H.C.C., and, with the exception of a few minor transfers,
carried on in the same efficient manner that had characterized them
from the organization of the M.H.C.C. By
constructing and taking over other large
buildings, the M.H.C.C. soon made adequate
arrangements for dealing with the
large number of soldiers returning from
Overseas. Pier 2 having been taken
over by the Militia Department for a
Clearing Hospital, it was transferred to
the M.H.C.C., February 15, 1917. Necessary
alterations delayed the opening of
this Hospital until April 1, 1917. Its
worth as a Hospital was well demonstrated
both while under the command of
the M.H.C.C. and later under the command of the Clearing Services.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pine Hill Presbyterian Theological College, Halifax, was taken
over by the M.H.C.C. as a Convalescent Hospital on March 1, 1917,
and Capt. M. S. Hunt was placed in charge, with Major Philip
Weatherbe, Senior Medical Officer, and Capt. John Cameron, Resident
Medical Officer. Capt. Dexter McCurdy was also a member
of the Medical Staff but was transferred on Overseas service in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>August, 1918. This Hospital, situated as it was, on the shores of
the Northwest Arm, Halifax, proved a great boon to the returned
convalescent soldiers. Its location adjoining Point Pleasant Park
was an ideal one for the care and comfort of convalescent soldiers.
There was an abundance of pure air, shady trees, and pleasant
walks, and though quite removed from Halifax City and its noisy
traffic, it was still sufficiently near to permit men able to walk to
get a tram car running into the city, where they could enjoy a few
hours with friends at a theatre or elsewhere. At the rear of the
Home the waters of the Northwest Arm gave the men ample
opportunity for boating, bathing and various other water sports, of
which they took full advantage during the summer months. It is
the unanimous opinion of the returned soldiers that Pine Hill was
the <em>Ideal</em> Convalescent Hospital in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In May, 1917, the Moxham Convalescent Hospital at Sydney,
C.B., was opened, with Major F. O’Neil in command. Major
O’Neil who had been in command of the Ross Convalescent Home
from December, 1916, was an efficient officer and discharged his
duties in a very satisfactory manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the latter part of July, 1916, an arrangement was made
with Dr. F. A. Miller, of the Kentville Sanitarium, to deal with
tuberculosis patients; for a great number of the men returning
from Overseas were pronounced tubercular. Within a very few
days Kentville Sanitarium was full of patients, and although from
time to time large additions were built to the Sanitarium, it was
always taxed to its utmost capacity. In fact during the summer of
1917, many hospital tents were erected on the Sanitarium grounds,
for the accommodation of tubercular patients, and when autumn
with its cold winds became too severe, many patients had to be sent
to their own homes, to be treated until room was available at the
Sanitarium, when they were recalled. Great credit is due to Dr.
Miller for the splendid manner in which he dealt with the patients
under his control. Capt. A. G. Forster, a returned officer, was in
charge of Administration and Discipline of the Kentville Sanitarium
and was a conscientious, hard-working officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 1, 1917, “B” Unit had on its strength 1,886 officers
and other ranks all receiving medical treatment. About 50 per cent.
of this number were out-patients, with home leave. These men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>were recalled to the Hospital from time to time as their physical
condition demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time New Brunswick became a separate Military
District, and it was decided to organize a separate M.H.C.C. Unit
for New Brunswick. This was accordingly done, and the transfer
of men and documents was completed in July, 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early spring of 1917 construction work was begun on a
Convalescent Hospital at Camp Hill, Halifax, and by October 1,
1917, the building was completed sufficiently to receive patients.
This hospital was fitted up with all modern medical appliances and
proved a Godsend to the people of Halifax, when on December
6, 1917, the city was shocked by the terrific explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the opening of Camp Hill Hospital, Lieutenant Blackwood
was placed in charge by the M.H.C.C. and Major (now Lieut.-Col.)
C. Morris was Senior Medical Officer. An efficient Staff was soon
organized which carried on until the Hospital was transferred to
the A.M.C. on December 6, 1917. Immediately after the explosion
all patients able to walk were given home leave and the Hospital
and Staff complete was turned over to the Medical Relief Commission
for the purpose of dealing with the sufferers of the explosion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer of this article has visited Casualty Clearing Hospitals
in Flanders on “Clearing Day” but never has he seen such human
suffering as he saw at Camp Hill Hospital when he walked into the
Hospital at 4 p.m. on December 6, 1917. The Hospital at Pier 2,
also the offices of the M.H.C.C. were destroyed by the explosion.
The Hospital was quickly rebuilt, but the offices were removed to
Leith House, Hollis Street, Halifax, and these offices were retained
until the Unit was disbanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 31, 1918, the Military Hospitals Commission Command
was disbanded by an Order-in-Council. The military end of
the work was taken over by No. 6 District Depot, and the civilian
end by the D.S.C.R. Final transfer of all equipment and records,
etc., of the M.H.C.C. to No. 6 District Depot was effected on April
18, 1918.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <em>ACADIA UNIVERSITY AND THE WAR.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In common with other universities in the Empire, Acadia emptied
her halls when the call to duty came. Her ideals had always
been those directly opposed to war, but to carry out these
ideals, it was necessary to participate in it. Between six and seven
hundred Acadia men and women enlisted. There was no definite
Unit formed by the Acadia men, but they were found in all departments
of the service. Sixty were in the Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade, mostly in “D” Company, 219th Battalion; and their
Platoon, number 13, won the Brigade trophy for efficiency. Ten
students left Acadia at one time with the 4th Universities Company
Reinforcements, Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry. The
attendance at the University was cut down to about one half, notwithstanding
the fact that the number of young women remained
constant. The Freshman class was unusually large, but as soon as
the age of eighteen was reached, practically no fit man remained.
Of the Acadia students, sixty-three lost their lives in service, sixty-two
young men and one young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have no definite figures concerning honors, but about eighty
were conferred on Acadia men, one of which was the coveted
Victoria Cross, the only one awarded to a college man in the
Maritime Provinces, and, in fact, the only one awarded to a Maritime
Province Unit. One of our Acadia men had the distinction
of being the youngest Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army,
commanding the 10th Alberta when twenty-six years of age. He
received the D.S.O. and two Bars, the Military Cross, was five
times mentioned in dispatches, and was recommended for the
Victoria Cross. The only colored chaplain in the British Army
was an Acadia man. In addition to those who enlisted in the
Canadian Expeditionary Force, we had a number who enlisted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>the Americans, and still others who enlisted with the British, all
of whom gave splendid account of themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the War broke out, there was a branch of the C.O.T.C.
at Acadia, but it went out of business early because practically every
member enlisted. The officer in charge of the C.O.T.C. for Military
District No. 6 told me that a larger number of C.O.T.C. men went
from Acadia than from any other Maritime University. Since the
War, many students have returned to the University to complete
their work, and, without exception, they are making excellent records.
Acadia has offered one year’s free tuition to returned men,
being the only university in Canada to do that.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1919, the returned men at Acadia met, and, after consultation,
decided that something should be done in the way of a Memorial for
those who had given their lives in the War. The suggestion was
made that this memorial should take the form of a Gymnasium,
typifying the splendid physical condition, the manly vigor, and
sporting spirit of the boys who went Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1914 our Gymnasium had been destroyed by fire, and a committee
of eight young men had been appointed to raise funds for a
new Gymnasium. Of these eight, six had dropped the burden of
responsibility of the Gymnasium and had gone to war, one of whom
was killed at Passchendaele. It seemed most fitting that their work
should be carried out by those who were left, and the next of kin
of all those who had given their lives were consulted, and agreed to
the proposal.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result, this Gymnasium is now in process of construction,
and will be a building in every way suitable as a Memorial for those
boys who have fallen. On May 26, 1920, General Sir Arthur W.
Currie, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., D.S.O., formerly Commander of the
Canadian Corps in France, laid the corner stone of the new Gymnasium
and delivered an address on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we feel that Acadia’s part in the War was no more than
it should have been, we are justly proud of the willing sacrifice, the
ready response, and the splendid record made by our Acadia men.</p>

Staff; (4) Independent Undergraduate Enlistment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Officers’ Training Corps.</span>—Great Britain was forced to
declare war on Germany on August 4, 1914; so that when the
University session of 1914 opened, it was under war conditions.
The earliest corporate war effort of Dalhousie University was a
mass meeting in the Law Library, held on October 16, 1914, for
the purpose of taking steps to form an O.T.C. The chair was
taken by Earle C. Phinney, at that time President of the Council
of Students. The meeting, which was most enthusiastic, was addressed
by President Mackenzie, G. S. Campbell, Chairman of the
Board of Governors, and by Major W. E. Thompson, Secretary of
the Board. It was ultimately agreed to ask Major Thompson to
organize an O.T.C.; and all those willing to co-operate were invited
to sign the roll. Ninety-two names were given in at once on the
conclusion of the meeting; of these, five were whole-time Professors.
Drill began at once in the South End Rink, Sergeant-Major
Graham of the Permanent Staff being instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Alumni and business men interested were permitted to join, and
there was so much activity in the autumn of 1914 that by the middle
of December the Corps was ready to be inspected by General Sir
Sam Hughes, Minister of Militia. The inspection took place on
December 18th in the South End Skating Rink. The maximum
strength during the first winter session was close on 200. On May
4, 1915, the Corps was inspected by General Rutherford, commanding
the Garrison. Lectures continued well on into the summer of
1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the session of 1916 Professor John Cameron, of London,
had been appointed to the Campbell Memorial Chair of Anatomy in
Dalhousie University, and having had a considerable amount of
military experience both with the Volunteer Artillery in Scotland
and with Infantry Volunteers in England, was well qualified to take
command of the O.T.C., Major Thompson, as Lieutenant-Colonel,
having been appointed to the Headquarters Staff as A.A.G. of
Military District No. 6. This Professor Cameron did with the rank
of Major, and retained the command and gave most of the systematic
instruction during the remainder of the existence of the Corps. By
arrangement with Colonel Papineau, commanding the R.S.I., candidates
for commissions were examined at Wellington Barracks. In
this way a considerable number of members of the O.T.C. obtained
commissions and were enabled to proceed Overseas with the various
Units which were being formed as the War progressed. No less
than seven officers who had passed through the D.U.C.O.T.C. went
Overseas with the 219th Battalion of the Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade. Practically every able-bodied male student was a member
of the O.T.C. during the first winter session; and no less than
twenty-five members of it were students from the affiliated Presbyterian
College at Pine Hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The session of 1916–17 was a very strenuous one. Drill took
place in the evenings at the newly-erected Market Building at the
head of Duke Street, Major Cameron superintending the drill and
also giving lectures either there or in the rooms of the Board of
Trade. During each winter firing practice was systematically carried
out at the miniature ranges erected in the Engineering Laboratory
of the Technical College. In March, 1917, the Corps was inspected
in the Market Building by Major Cooper of the R.S.I. The O.T.C.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>is still in existence ready to become active again as soon as the
University is in possession of a drill hall.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Stationary Hospital Unit.</span>—The origin of No. 7 Stationary
Hospital was the desire of the Medical Faculty of the University to
serve their country in the Great War. Early in September, 1914,
an offer was made to provide the personnel of a Casualty Clearing
Station; this offer was renewed in the spring of 1915, but the
Federal Government was not at that time in a position to accept it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very generally felt that the only School of Medicine in
the Maritime Provinces ought to have a representation on the
Canadian Expeditionary Force. Those who were the most active
in renewing the offer were Major George M. Campbell, Major C. V.
Hogan, and Capts. J. R. Corston, M. A. MacAulay, L. M. Murray
and F. V. Woodbury. The Government accepted the offer on
September 27, 1915. On November 1st, the old Medical College
building was occupied as rooms for headquarters, and enlistment
and training began. On December 16th the Unit was inspected by
General Benson, G.O.C., and by Col. J. A. Grant, A.D.M.S., Military
District No. 6. On December 31st the Hospital sailed from St.
John, N.B., on <em>H.M.S. Metagama</em>, arriving at Plymouth on January
10, 1916. On February 5th the Unit took over Shorncliffe Military
Hospital, and on June 18, 1916, embarked for France.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personnel of the Dalhousie Hospital Unit was made up as
follows: O.C., Lieut.-Colonel John Stewart, Majors E. V. Hogan
and L. M. Murray, Capts. M. A. MacAulay, V. N. MacKay, K. A.
MacKenzie, E. K. MacLellan, S. J. MacLennan, D. A. MacLeod,
J. A. Murray, John Rankine, Frank V. Woodbury, Karl F. Woodbury,
Lieut. S. R. Halcom, Lieut, and Quartermaster Walter
Taylor. The Matron was Miss L. M. Hubley, and there were
twenty-six nursing sisters. Of all other ranks there were one
hundred and twenty-three men. Sixteen additional men were taken
on at Shorncliffe, England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unit arrived home from active service early in the morning
of St. George’s Day, 1919, on the <em>S.S. Belgic</em>; in the evening they
were entertained at dinner at the Green Lantern in Halifax. Col.
John Stewart who returned a little later was entertained at a dinner
given in his honor on June 20, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span><span class='sc'>Activities of the Staff</span>: I. <em>The Faculty of Arts and Science.</em>—The
only full-time Professor in the Senate to go Overseas on active
service was Professor James Eadie Todd, M.A., who saw service
with the B.E.F. in India and in Mesopotamia. Professor Todd,
who remained with the troops until the end of the War, did not
return to Dalhousie University. Professor Howard Murray, LL.D.,
during the first year of the War, was a member of the O.T.C.
Professor MacNeill during the first year of the War had command
of a Platoon in the O.T.C. Professor J. N. Finlayson, M.Sc.,
entered the O.T.C. at its formation and qualified for a commission
in the infantry. Mr. J. W. Logan, M.A., went Overseas as Captain
in the 25th Canadian Infantry Battalion, attained his majority in
June, 1916, and.saw service in France until the end of the War.
The Rev. H. A. Kent, M.A., D.D., having passed through the O.T.C.
obtained his Captain’s commission on March 1, 1916, and went
Overseas as a combatant in the 219th Battalion of the Nova Scotia
Highlanders. Captain Kent saw service until September, 1917,
when he was transferred to the Chaplain Service, in which he acted
as Adjutant. He was also engaged in educational work in London
until he returned to Canada in May, 1919. Mr. Harry Dean,
Examiner in Music, had command of a Platoon in the O.T.C., and
qualified for a commission in the infantry.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. <em>The Faculty of Law.</em>—The Dean of the Faculty of Law,
Professor D. A. MacRae, Ph.D., joined the O.T.C. and had command
of a Platoon during the first session. Mr. John E. Read,
B.C.L. (Oxon.), B.A. (Dal.), Rhodes Scholar, Lecturer on Real
Property, enlisted in the 25th Battalion in November, 1914, but was
immediately transferred to the Canadian Field Artillery, and took
an officer’s training course at the Royal School of Artillery, Kingston.
In February, 1915, Mr. Read joined the 23rd Battery of the
C.F.A. at Fredericton and immediately proceeded Overseas. In
July he was transferred to the Divisional Artillery (1st Canadian
Division) and served in the 4th, 8th and 26th Batteries as Lieutenant,
being promoted to the rank of Captain in July, 1916, on his
transference to the 27th Battery. While Captain Read was Acting-Major
he was wounded in January, 1917. From May, 1917, to
March, 1918, he was Senior Gunnery Instructor at the Canadian
School of Gunnery, being invalided to Canada in April, 1918.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Captain Read was mentioned in Sir Douglas Haig’s dispatches in
June, 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. <em>Faculty of Medicine.</em>—After Professor Cameron relinquished
the command of the O.T.C. he reverted to the rank of
Captain, and entering the C.A.M.C. became Resident Physician of
the Military Hospital which had been installed in the Presbyterian
College at Pine Hill, Halifax.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor A. G. Nicholls, who attained the rank of Major,
entered the C.A.M.C. as Captain and discharged the duties of Chief
Bacteriologist, Serologist and Sanitary Officer for the Halifax
Garrison. Dr. W. H. Hattie, with rank of Captain, saw service
with the C.A.M.C. in Halifax. Professor Fraser Harris, with rank
of Captain, acted as Adjutant to the O.T.C. as long as that Corps
remained in activity. The governors could not see their way to
granting his request for leave of absence for Overseas service.
Besides addressing recruiting meetings, Professor Harris gave
courses of instruction in First Aid, under the auspices of the St.
John Ambulance Association, to large classes of men, both in the
service and to civilians, to women students and to cadets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following members of the Staff gave their services in the
C.A.M.C. in connection with the Halifax Garrison: Colonels George
M. Campbell and M. A. Curry; Capts. W. Bruce Almon, M. J.
Carney, J. S. Corston, J. F. Lawlor, G. A. Macintosh, Philip
Weatherbe and Hugh Schwartz.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. <em>The Faculty of Dentistry.</em>—Although the health of the Dean
of this Faculty, Dr. Frank Woodbury, precluded him from entering
military service, both his sons were able to go Overseas. The elder,
Frank Valentine, who at the outbreak of the War was already
acting D.A.D.M.S. in Military District No. 6, with the rank of
Captain, was immediately mobilized. This appointment he resigned
to become Adjutant in the No. 7 Stationary Hospital, C.E.F., in
1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August, 1916, Captain Woodbury was appointed to No. 3
Canadian Intrenching Battalion, and in August, 1916, proceeded to
the Front at Ypres with that Unit. Later he was posted to the
9th Canadian Field Ambulance, and saw service at Ypres, on the
Somme, at Vimy and at Loos. Having been promoted, Major
Woodbury was recalled to headquarters at London for Staff duty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>He was ultimately appointed A.D.M.S. with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel,
returning to Ottawa for duty in November, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. A. W. Cogswell, Professor of Dental Pathology and Therapeutics,
joined the O.T.C. in November, 1914, and as Captain had
command of a Platoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. George Kerr Thomson, Professor of Crown and Bridgework
and Ceramics and Oral Hygiene, at the outbreak of the War,
held the rank of Captain in the 63rd Halifax Rifles. Later he was
transferred to the C.A.D.C. and appointed Assistant Director of
Dental Services in Military District No. 6. When, early in 1915,
Sir Sam Hughes ordered the organization of the C.A.D.C. Major
Thomson was made First Director of Dental Services. In 1916 the
Dental Services at Valcartier Camp were organized by Major
Thomson with the assistance of Captain F. H. Bradley of Military
District No. 4. Dr. W. W. Woodbury, Professor of Orthodontia,
who had been appointed Captain in the C.A.D.C. in May,
1918, proceeded to Aldershot Camp, where as A.D.D.S. for the
Camp he had charge of all the Dental Services there. In October,
1918, Dr. Woodbury was posted for special duty at McNab’s
Island, where he remained until January, 1919, when he was appointed
to Camp Hill Hospital, to superintend the dental treatment
of returned soldiers. He remained at this centre until general
demobilization on November 15, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Undergraduate Enlistment.</em>—From the very first hour of the
War, the attention of the undergraduates had been directed to
joining the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Up to the date of the
Armistice five hundred and eighty members of the University had
enlisted for military or naval service, either Overseas or in Canada.
Of these, sixty-seven are known to have lost their lives, and forty-four
to have received decorations for distinguished service. Of
those who were decorated, five lost their lives. The decorations
are as follows:</p>

<table class='table2' summary=''>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>These do not include decorations awarded to members of the Staff.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The names of those winning the D.S.O. are: John Keeller
MacKay of Pictou (Law ’13–’15), Colonel and O.C. 22nd Battalion
6th Howitzer Brigade, B.E.F.  J. Layton Ralston (Law ’02–’03)
Amherst, Colonel and O.C. of the 85th Battalion, C.E.F. Barry
Wentworth Roscoe, of Kentville (LL.B. ’04), Major 5th C.M.R.,
C.E.F.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the outbreak of the War the University had on its books 398
students, of whom 90 were women. Of the 308 male students of
the session 1914–15 by the end of the session practically every third
man had enlisted for military service.</p>

<p class='c007'>So many students left the Presbyterian Theological College, Pine
Hill, Halifax, as to make it only the shadow of its former self. In
the session of 1914–15 as many as twenty-five students from Pine
Hill were drilling with the O.T.C.; thirteen men from this College
ultimately saw service Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of students of Engineering in the session of 1914–15, twenty-one
were enrolled in the O.T.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of Law students twenty-two were on the roll of the O.T.C.
during the first session.</p>

<p class='c007'>One cannot write of what Dalhousie University did in the War
without a few words as to what she suffered. The only son of the
Chairman of the Board of Governors, Mr. G. S. Campbell, LL.D.,
Lieut. George Henderson Campbell, was killed near Ypres in May,
1916. He had graduated B.A. in the previous May, and was within
only two days of his 21st birthday. Two Rhodes Scholars lost
their lives in the Great War, namely: Walter Melville Billman
(B.A. ’13), Lieut. 1st Middlesex Regiment, B.E.F.; and Harry
Austin MacCleave (B.A. ’16), Lieut. 13th Montreal Highlanders,
C.E.F. While the accidental death of the young, the healthy and
the brave is always a poignant sorrow, the passing of those who are
also the finest products of the academic culture of their day is a
catastrophe of the first magnitude.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLII.<br /> <em>KING’S COLLEGE AND KING’S COLLEGE SCHOOL IN THE WAR.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The University of King’s College at Windsor, N.S., has always
been small in numbers, but always big in the spirit
it has displayed and in the type of men it has fostered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was founded in 1789—the oldest University in the British
Dominions beyond the Seas—by United Empire Loyalists, by men
who readily gave up all they possessed in a material sense rather
than forsake their allegiance to an ideal. It is not surprising
then that at all times there have been King’s men ready to answer
the King’s call and that the names of men such as Inglis and
Welsford are held in special reverence by their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Mater</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spirit of loyal service and sacrifice that has actuated King’s
men was at once evident in her sons when the Great Call came in
1914, and King’s has every reason to be proud of her record of
loyalty and devotion in the Great War. More than four hundred
of her sons were at the King’s side during that fierce struggle for
freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1914 there were at least twelve King’s men, including seven
Generals, holding commissions in the Imperial Army and the Canadian
Permanent Forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourteen volunteers sailed with the First Contingent of the
Canadian Expeditionary Force, four of whom were killed in action.
The first King’s man to make the Great Sacrifice was Capt. G. L. B.
Concanon, who was killed in the Dardanelles Campaign while
serving with the 2nd Battalion of Australian Infantry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Second Contingent were some thirty-five students and
graduates of the College and a number of “Old Boys” of the
School.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the notable enlistments from College during the War
were the nine who volunteered for service in the Cycle Corps of the
2nd Contingent, and some twenty, mostly students, who enlisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>together in the 193rd Battalion, Nova Scotia Highland Brigade.
This latter represented an enlistment of about 50 per cent. of the
student body then in residence at King’s College and included one
of her Professors.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the period of the War the largest number of male
students in attendance at King’s College was forty-eight, and this
number was reduced to a few physically unfit men in 1917, and yet
sixty-seven students actually enlisted from the College, and ten of
them made the supreme sacrifice. In all twenty-three King’s men
fell in action on the Field of Honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>So reduced was the student body that when the Military Service
Act came into effect there was not one physically fit student left to
come under the provisions of that Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in 1915 a contingent of the Canadian Officers’ Training
Corps was organized at King’s College under Professor Sturley as
Officer Commanding, and did very useful work not only amongst
the students at College, but also amongst the young men of Windsor,
the seat of King’s College. Its active life, however was short,
for within about twelve months of its organization practically the
whole of the personnel of the Corps had enlisted for Overseas
Service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the honors gained by King’s men during the War were:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Of the many who distinguished themselves by gallant service,
whether officially recognized or not, the record of a few of the
younger generation must suffice as typical of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two of the first students to enlist were Edward Jeffery and
George Mason. They enlisted together in the ranks of the First
Contingent, 17th Battalion, and went over to France together with
the 14th Battalion, 1st Canadian Division. For sixteen months
they fought side by side—all through the terrible winter of 1914–1915
in the Ypres Salient—and came through that fiery ordeal unscathed.
They returned to England together for their commissions,
training together at Crowborough. Mason returned to France
almost immediately after the course, but Jeffery was taken ill and
was operated on for appendicitis; and it was not till April, 1918,
that he was again sent to France. In June, 1918, he joined his new
Battalion, 16th Canadian Scottish, and found himself posted to a
Company commanded by Mason, now a Captain. So they were
together again in France. On the night of the 26th September
Jeffery received his first wound, but it proved fatal, and the next
day he was laid to rest at Ligny St. Frochel, near St. Pol. Only four
days later, on October 1st, his great chum followed, and so these
two, who for four long years had borne the burden and strife of the
Great War with what seemed charmed lives, were reunited once
more in that land where there is no more parting and no more
strife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arthur Leigh Collett, B.A., had left King’s for Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar, but at once forsook his work at Oxford and enlisted
in the Imperial Army. He served in France as a Lieutenant
with the 8th Gloucesters, and in the autumn of 1915, in the Battle
of Messines Ridge he was reported missing and later believed
killed. Others from his Battalion reported missing at the same
time were later reported as prisoners of war in Germany. There
is little doubt that Collett fought gallantly facing the odds and
choosing to meet death rather than to cease for a moment, while
life lasted, from striving for the ideals of justice and righteousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>A. B. C. Hilbert was one of the most popular students and
one of the best athletes at King’s. Enlisting with the Cycle Corps
he transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service on reaching England.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>In July, 1917, he wrote: “I am at present resting after a twenty-two
weeks’ illness due to a little ducking I got in the North Sea.
I am flying again in August.” In October came the news that he
had fallen a second time in the North Sea, and now there he rests
with many other gallant sons of Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the others who enlisted with him in the Cycle Corps, Turnbull
and McCormick rest in soldiers’ graves in Flanders; Crawford died
in hospital ere he saw the foe; Foster and Parlee are back with us
at King’s, and though Parlee has lost a leg, his breast is adorned
with that proud emblem of bravery, the Distinguished Conduct
Medal; Brittain has recovered from his serious wounds and is serving
the King of Peace; Harley, Hallett and the rest are giving the
same good account of themselves that they always gave as loyal
sons of King’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Stewart Burchell was one of that little band who enlisted
together with the 193rd Battalion, Nova Scotia Highland Brigade,
and joined the 85th Battalion in France. He was one of the most
promising of the younger sons of King’s, a clever, manly, gentlemanly
young fellow. He fought for the cause of liberty and right
and now rests in a soldier’s grave in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the records of the King’s College Advance Movement is
the entry, “George Stewart Burchell, killed at the Front, his pay at
his request, $100.” May King’s never cease to honor the memory
of this loyal and gallant son.</p>

<p class='c007'>W. B. Ernst enlisted as a private in the 193rd Battalion, rose
to the rank of Captain in the 85th Battalion, and was awarded the
Military Cross and Bar. Ernst has not rested on his laurels, and
since his return here has shown that in the field of scholarship, too,
he will take no second place, and has captured the Rhodes Scholarship
from the Province of Nova Scotia. King’s will ever have
reason to be proud of the records of Ernst, so affectionately known
as “Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of others whom King’s will always delight to honor may be
mentioned Capt. D. L. Teed, M.C., and Gunner L. Wilkinson, who
fell gallantly serving their guns, Lieut. W. E. Warburton, D.CM.,
rewarded for his bravery in the Dardanelles, Lieut.-Col. C. R. E.
Willets, D.S.O., the gallant and popular Commanding Officer of
the R.C.R. in France, and now commanding the famous “Princess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Pats,” Cecil Blanchard, M.M., who was too young to enlist except
as a bugler, but not too young to show that he came of loyal fighting
stock; and the Campbell brothers, six of whom saw active service,
and two of whom, Colin and Kenneth, lie “out there,” somewhere
in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though these records are brief and unworthy may they suffice
to show that the true spirit of King’s still lives in her sons, and
that they, as of old, have upheld nobly her best traditions and
realized in some measure her ideals of service,</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In the Great War students, past and present, of St. Francis
Xavier University served in every branch of the Forces of
Canada, and in the armies and navies of Great Britain, France
and America. But it is the especial pride of St. Francis Xavier
to have furnished a complete Unit, if a small one, of the Canadian
Expeditionary Forces. The Unit was officially known as No. 9
Stationary Hospital, C.A.M.C.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Unit was organized in November, 1915, and was for some
time quartered in the University itself. It left Canada for the
United Kingdom in June, 1916, and proceeded to France in November
of the following year. Till April, 1918, it was stationed at
St. Omer, but the great German offensive of that spring made
necessary its withdrawal to Etaples, where it became part of the
hospital system of the main British base.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the notorious bombardment of May 18, 1918, No. 9 was the
first hospital to be attacked, and suffered severely. Its premises
were completely destroyed, and more than forty per cent. of its personnel
became casualties. Towards the end of 1918, the status of
the St. Francis Xavier Unit was raised to that of a General
Hospital. It returned to Canada in July, 1919, and upon the reorganization
of the Military Forces of Canada, was preserved as an
integral part of the Active Militia.</p>

<p class='c007'>More than three hundred and fifty Xavierians joined the colors.
Thirty-three were killed, or died on active service. The following
decorations were won by students or alumni of the University:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Three professors of the Faculty of the University saw active
service in the Canadian, Imperial and American Forces respectively;
two were severely wounded and one received the Military Cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Canada during the War St. Francis Xavier took a becoming
part in the forefront of every patriotic activity. A contingent of
the Canadian Officers’ Training Corps was gazetted in April, 1915.
Training had hardly been begun when the Corps lost the majority
of its officers by enlistment and with the numbers of students continually
dwindling—at one commencement a single individual presented
himself for graduation—it became impossible to continue
parades.</p>

<p class='c007'>In every branch of war work pursued in the neighborhood of
Antigonish, the locale of the University, the lead was taken by
members of the Staff of St. Francis Xavier. The chairman of
the local committee for the Patriotic Fund, the Antigonish County
Organizer of the Victory Loan Campaign, and the Director of the
re-establishment activities of the Knights of Columbus over a wide
area of Eastern Nova Scotia, were professors of the University. In
connection with the patriotic work of the Knights of Columbus, it
may be mentioned St. Francis Xavier did its full share in the launching
of the Dominion-wide campaign, which made it possible for
this body to perform its splendid services to our troops at the scene
of war. In brief in St. Francis Xavier, as in all the universities of
the land, it was the aim of all compelled to “carry on” at home to
become, by patriotic endeavor and sacrifice, not unworthy of those
who went from it to fight their country’s and the Empire’s battles.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br /> <em>THE PRESBYTERIAN COLLEGE AND THE GREAT WAR.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Ministers of the Gospel are the avowed ambassadors of
the Prince of Peace; and it is so constantly their task to allay
the passions of the human heart and to preach universal
love, particularly in their appeals for foreign missions, that many
people felt that their ideal was at variance with the spirit of war
and were prepared to find students for the ministry offering for
other forms of patriotic service than fighting in the line. The
extraordinary response of theological colleges and of sons of the
manse all over the Empire showed how mistaken this idea had
been. The message of the Cross and the call to self-sacrifice had
quite the opposite effect. Young men who were going to be
preachers experienced a new sense of responsibility; they knew that
they could not consistently call others to a life of service and suffering,
if they were not prepared themselves to lead the way. This
is the attitude that prevailed among the students at Pine Hill, which
is the oldest Presbyterian Theological College in Canada, and which
will celebrate in 1920 its centenary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intensity of this conviction surprised every one on the parade
ground of the South End Rink, Halifax, when Col. W. E. Thompson
organized the O.T.C. of Dalhousie University. The large majority
of the students in residence at Pine Hill were there. The Divinity
classes open late, and thus many had been in the city only a few
days when this call came in the beginning of November, 1914.
Colonel Thompson has on several public occasions paid a fine tribute
to these theological men; and they in return frankly acknowledge
how much they were moved by the frank and earnest appeal of the
Colonel himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The O.T.C. was but a voluntary and preliminary phase of the
grave decision; but it had a most stimulating effect, and nearly all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the students who joined its ranks found themselves ultimately in
active service. Right on the heels of the O.T.C. came the formation
of a small Cycle Corps Unit, to which three from Pine Hill
were admitted, the first to enlist for Overseas. This Unit was
almost entirely made up of students, and its advent in Halifax was
celebrated by a dinner given in the residence at Pine Hill. The
dining hall was crowded. Colonel Thompson and Colonel Grant,
A.D.M.S., spoke; the impression made was very deep; and probably
at that hour a large number made up their minds to join the
colors. The impression was intensified by the dramatic announcement
in the course of the dinner of the splendid sea victory at
Falkland Islands, the news of which had just come over the wire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the year was out there came an urgent appeal for an
Ambulance Corps, and fifteen responded. Few of them stayed
long in the Army Medical Corps after they got across, but asked
for transfers to fighting units, in which they played their part
nobly, and where some of them laid down their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in 1915 the 6th Mounted Rifles were formed and eight
more joined, going to England in July. In the summer four others
enlisted in the No. 7 Overseas Hospital (The Dalhousie) Unit; and
in the winter, 1915–16, five enlisted in the Nova Scotia Highland
Brigade and five in the artillery. By the second anniversary of the
War the great bulk of the Divinity students had entered the army,
and most of these were already Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below is given a list of the names and of the Units to which
they were eventually attached, and henceforward their history
becomes identified with their Units and is told elsewhere. There
were forty-eight in all, including the Principal and Professor H. A.
Kent, who were ultimately on the strength of the Chaplain Service.
Two received the Military Cross and one the Military Medal; seven
paid the supreme sacrifice; and many were wounded or gassed. All
but seven of those who survived continued their studies for the
ministry on their return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following is the roll of honor:</p>

<p class='c019'>John Ross, a Scotch lad, who, in the beginning of the War, joined
the fleet, and went down with the <em>Indefatigable</em> in the Battle of
Jutland.</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur P. MacIvor, from Cape Breton, joined the C.M.R., and

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLV.<br /> <em>RECRUITING IN NOVA SCOTIA.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The number of men of military age in Canada at the outbreak
of the War was approximately 1,720,000, and of this Nova
Scotia’s quota was 53,500. As the War progressed it was
decided that Canada’s contribution would be 500,000 and Nova
Scotia’s proportion 30,000, which was attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first no particular effort was made by the public to raise the
various Units, the matter being left entirely in the hands of the
Military. The 1st Field Ambulance and the 17th Field Battery
proceeded to Valcartier as Units, and thence Overseas with the First
Division. The 17th, Nova Scotia’s first Battalion, to our lasting
disgrace, was left to paddle its own canoe to the rocks in Salisbury
Plains, where it eventually became the 17th Reserve Battalion,
supplying reinforcements to the Nova Scotia Units in the Field.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 25th was the first Battalion in which the public evinced any
interest. This was mainly recruited from Militia Units, a large proportion
coming from the Island of Cape Breton and from Halifax.
The 40th Battalion and the 6th Canadian Mounted Rifles, authorized
in February, 1915, were recruited with comparative ease, the 40th
entirely from Nova Scotia and the 6th C.M.R. from the three
Maritime Provinces. At this time the 25th had not proceeded
Overseas, and it was not until May that this Battalion, which in
France earned for itself the title of the “Fighting 25th,” sailed from
Halifax, taking as its final complement part of the 40th Battalion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 40th was then sent to Aldershot, N.S., for training, and
was almost immediately called upon to supply a draft of 5 officers
and 250 men. About this time recruiting slackened. The strength
of the 40th dwindled, due to casualties from sickness and other
causes, and it seemed that unless a special effort were made by the
public this Unit would share the fate of the 17th, or worse. Mr.
G. S. Campbell, whose son was among the officers of this Unit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>brought back from Valcartier the news that unless the Battalion
was quickly brought up to strength it would be absorbed into a
Battalion of another Province, and Nova Scotia would lose it. A
strong Committee of prominent citizens was immediately formed.
Money for advertising was subscribed, and a campaign launched,
the effect of which never ceased during the period of the War. The
40th was brought up to full strength, and in October proceeded
Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of the efforts of this Committee it was thought by
Headquarters M.D. No. 6 that the work of recruiting throughout
the Province should be inspected and reported on. Lieut.-Col. H.
Flowers was selected to undertake this duty. Every important town
in the Province was visited except in Cape Breton, which was supplying
many men through the energetic work of the Rev. E. Watering
Florence. The prominent people in each town were induced to
lend their assistance, forming such organizations as they in their
wisdom deemed best. All the assistance that headquarters and the
Halifax Committee could give was supplied at the request of the
other centres.</p>

<p class='c007'>This proved most successful and when the 64th was authorized
in August, 1915, to be recruited from the three Maritime Provinces,
so great was the enthusiasm in Nova Scotia that in three weeks the
full complement was supplied by that Province alone, and later the
men from New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island became the
nucleus for the 104th New Brunswick Battalion. Lieut.-Colonel
Flowers went to the 64th as Second in Command, and Major
W. B. A. Ritchie was appointed Officer in Charge of Recruiting. He
was followed in December, 1916, by Major G. B. Cutten, of the
Nova Scotia Highland Brigade. These officers were assisted by
Capt. F. W. Micklewright and Capt. F. T. DeWolfe. Apart from
Capt. E. W. Florence, Captain Micklewright probably recruited
more men personally than any other officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 64th Battalion being over strength, the 85th Battalion, Nova
Scotia Highlanders, authorized some time previously, was ordered
to proceed with recruiting. Numbers flocked to join its ranks.
Men of responsible positions and lucrative salaries offered their
services. In less than a month the Battalion was over strength
and a large number of applicants were turned away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>In the gloomy closing days of 1915, when the withdrawal of the
Gallipoli Expedition was announced, and many cherished expectations
were again doomed to disappointment, the whole British
Empire was profoundly stirred, and began to take its grip with
characteristic bulldog tenacity. All its resources were demanded,
every available man must go. Consequently in January of 1916 the
question was mooted, why should not Nova Scotia give a whole
Highland Brigade, and those who applied too late for admission to
the 85th be afforded another and more liberal opportunity of going
to the Front? Perhaps no idea ever suggested in the Province was
taken up with more hearty enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first few weeks of 1916 organization was developed
with great assiduity. It was decided to make use of the popular
85th in the work of recruiting. Every soldier who believed he could
recruit another man was given six days’ leave to do so; and if he
succeeded in recruiting more than one he was granted an additional
six days. Officers who volunteered to raise a Platoon were given
charge of the territory in which it could be recruited. The results
were in some instances amazing. Lads who seemed unlikely enough
brought in recruits by the score.</p>

<p class='c007'>In preparation for this great “drive” a publicity campaign was
organized on an extensive scale. Pulpit, press and schoolroom
were commandeered, and gave themselves up generously to the work.
Religious services were arranged at which moral issues of the War
were brought home forcibly to the people. Military uniforms appeared
in the pulpits and unwonted martial strains, even from the
bagpipes, were heard in sacred precincts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most unique feature of the campaign was the use
made of the public schools. The Union Jack was widely displayed.
The children were drilled in patriotic songs. Books were laid aside
and mass meetings held at which prominent citizens delivered
addresses until to the impressionable mind of the little children it
was incredible that anyone should stay at home. A letter was
addressed by Lieut.-Colonel Borden to the boys and girls of Nova
Scotia. In simple language he explained the meaning of the War,
and converted every child into an irrepressible recruiting agent
among his big brothers at home, or in the circle of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>When the country had thus been duly prepared, and public
feeling was running high, the master-stroke was given, which resulted
in the raising of “three Battalions in three weeks,” a feat
unsurpassed in the recruiting efforts of Canada. This was a series
of meetings, held in every town, village and country hall, crowded
to the doors, and characterized by the intense fervor of a religious
revival. Notable among those who took part in the campaign for
the 193rd and 219th Battalions were Lieut.-Colonel Borden, Lieut.-Colonel
Guthrie (invalided home from the Front), President Cutten
of Acadia University, Dr. Clarence McKinnon, and a score of other
public men, who gladly gave time and talent to the task. The band
of the 85th Battalion accompanied the speakers in their tour through
the counties of Lunenburg, Queens, Shelburne, Yarmouth, Annapolis,
Digby, Kings, Pictou and Antigonish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cape Breton had already contributed the 17th and 36th Batteries
(the latter Unit was raised in a single day), a large proportion of
the 25th and 40th Battalions, six hundred men to the 64th, three
hundred men to the 85th, three hundred men to the 106th, besides
keeping at full strength its Militia Regiment, the 94th Argyll Highlanders,
which had been on active service from the outbreak of
the War. Not satisfied with this the Island asked for and received
authority to recruit a purely Cape Breton Infantry Battalion, to be
included in the Nova Scotia Highland Brigade. Under the supervision
of Major Gordon S. Harrington (later appointed Deputy
Overseas Minister and promoted to the rank of Colonel) Cape
Breton officers and men of the 83th Battalion returned to their
former homes and engaged in active recruiting. Meetings were held
in every town and village, and addresses made by Mayor Richardson,
F. A. Crowell, A. D. Gunn, D. A. Cameron, Dr. C. E. McMillan,
Stuart McCawley, the late D. A. Hearn, and many other prominent
people. As a result of their work, and in spite of the restrictions
placed upon them by the G.O.C. M.D. No. 6, who forbade the
enlistment of employees of the Dominion Coal Company and the
Dominion Iron and Steel Company, the 185th Battalion, Cape
Breton Highlanders was recruited to full strength within three
weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1916, Mr. F. A. Crowell was requested to act as Chief
Recruiting Officer for the County of Cape Breton. In a civilian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>capacity and without remuneration he accepted the position, and,
assisted by Lieutenant Chirgwin and Sergt. A. Johnstone of the 94th
Regiment, carried on the work until January, 1917. Up to the time
the Military Service Act came into force the Island of Cape Breton
contributed over seven thousand volunteers, including, in addition
to the Units already named, 100 men to the 246th Battalion, 200
men to the Composite Battalion, besides a large number to the
several Artillery Units mobilized at Halifax, to the 165th, 169th
and 239th Battalions, the Army Service Corps, Forestry Units,
Railway Troops and Army Medical Services, with a lower record of
rejection than in any other district in Canada—in the case of the
185th only three per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have been impossible for the Chief Recruiting Officer
and his Staff of paid officers and men to have made the success they
did had it not been for the valuable services rendered by the voluntary
recruiting officers all over the Province. These men worked
faithfully throughout the War without remuneration, and not infrequently
labored under misrepresentation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVI.<br /> <em>OCEAN TRANSPORT.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The importance of the work done in Military District No. 6
during the period of the Great War is doubtless not realized
by the public, other than those who were directly interested
in the work. Aside from Halifax being a fortified port, and the
Naval Base of the Atlantic Fleet during the War, it was the point of
embarkation of the Canadian troops for Overseas, with the exception
of the First Contingent, which was sent Overseas from Quebec.
Therefore the work, devolving on District No. 6, in handling the
enormous number of Canadian, American, Australian and New
Zealand troops that passed through here was a matter of considerable
responsibility and care, not only in checking the men going on
board ship, but also in providing accommodations, rations, etc.,
while they were held ashore at Halifax from a day to three or four
weeks, awaiting the arrival of their transports. In addition it was
necessary to make preparations for emergencies, of which there
were several, including such things as the stranding of a troopship
near the mouth of Halifax Harbor, which necessitated the safe removal,
landing and caring for the troops by other than the regular
methods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The detail work in connection with these duties was great and
varied. For instance, the Department at Ottawa would arrange the
date for the sailing of transports and the allotment of troops for
each. The Department would then notify this district accordingly.
The troops allotted to each ship would arrive by special trains, often
before their transport reached port. During this period of waiting
many casualties would occur, either through absentees, sickness, or
from other causes, necessitating extra accommodation at the local
quarters or in hospital. On the arrival of the ship these men would
have to be checked on board individually, all casualties accounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>for, complete returns made out, such as marching out state, lists of
officers, inspection of all documents, and many other details. After
that particular ship was loaded she would pull away from the pier
and remain in harbor awaiting the loading of the other transports.
Very often these transports would lie in the harbor for some days
before sailing, awaiting the completion of the convoy, a result being
that additional casualties would occur daily on each ship during
that period. These had to be taken off the ship, in turn, all documents
corrected to date so that when the ship sailed from the harbor
an accurate record of every man on board was complete and thus
enabled the Government to check the proper charges of the Steamship
Companies for transportation. In the early stages of the War
transports to the number of forty would sail from Halifax in one
convoy, but towards the latter end of the War the Naval Authorities
provided for convoys not exceeding seventeen ships at one time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all there were 284,455 Canadian troops embarked from Halifax.
Some 50,000 Chinamen, and a large number of American
troops also embarked from this port. In addition, ships with New
Zealanders and Australians on board called at this port to join the
convoys, and often were allowed to land for route marches and
given shore leave. This also entailed much work on this district,
due to the necessity of looking after casualties, absentees, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the casualties occurring during these embarkations a careful
record had to be kept, and in due course, that is, as soon as
possible after they became fit or were apprehended, they were sent
Overseas on later transports.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many complicated questions arose during this period, as, for
instance, men arriving on troop trains under arrest for misdemeanors
of various kinds, and thus necessitating this district dealing
with such cases.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVII.<br /> <em>MUNITIONS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>A brief history of the work of the Shell Committee, its
organization, and the part played by the Nova Scotia Steel
and Coal Company in producing munitions during the first
two and a half years of the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>On September 8, 1915, Col. Alex Bertram, Thomas Cantley, and
George W. Watts were summoned by the Federal Minister of
Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to Valcartier. On meeting the Minister he
stated that the British Secretary of State for War had advised the
Canadian Government that the War Office were desirous of having
shrapnel shells made in Canada, that the Canadian Government had
decided to entrust the matter to a Committee of Manufacturers, and
had so advised the War Office. It was understood that the advice
of the Minister had been accepted, and that the names of the three
gentlemen above referred to had been approved by the War Office
as a Committee to carry on the work on their behalf. The men
above named were then asked to serve as such Committee, without
remuneration, which they agreed to do, and were requested to select
one of their number as Chairman. On the suggestion of Thos.
Cantley, Colonel Bertram was appointed Chairman, the Minister
confirming the appointment of the Committee by a memorandum
initialed “For Action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, Mr. E. Carnegie, of Welland, was added to the Committee,
and at their request the Minister agreed that Colonel Benson,
Master General of Ordnance; Colonel Lafferty, Superintendent of
the Dominion Arsenal; and Colonel Greville Harston, Inspector of
Arms and Ammunition, should be added as Technical Members.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first meeting was held the same evening (September 8th)
at the Chateau Frontenac, Quebec. The second meeting was held
the following day at the office of the Superintendent of the
Dominion Arsenal. The Committee were accorded the privilege of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>dissecting the manufacturing costs of the various operations involved
in making shells of this type at the Dominion Arsenal, which
at that time had an out-turn of about 200 per day.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the data there available and their experience as manufacturers
the Committee advised the War Office that 200,000 shrapnel
shells could be produced by the Committee and supplied to the War
Office at a price of $8.30 for the 15–pounder, and $8.55 each for
the 18–pounder. On this information being cabled to London the
Committee were at once instructed to proceed with the order.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_312.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>COL. THOMAS CANTLEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the order was in process of execution a contract was presented
by a representative of the War Office to the four civilian
members, viz., Messrs. Bertram, Cantley, Watt and Carnegie, under
which contract they were obligated to supply the War Office with
these shells at the prices stated. This contract was duly executed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the Honorable Minister of Militia signing on behalf of and representing,
the War Office, the civilian members signing on their own
behalf.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the first order was for 200,000 shells, additional orders
were placed by the War Office with the Committee at various times
between September, 1914, and November, 1915, aggregating in all
$345,222,870.24. The contract prices were in most cases named by
the War Office. In some cases the prices were the result of compromise
arranged by cable between the Committee and the War Office.
In other cases the prices were those suggested by the Committee and
were accepted by the War Office.</p>

<p class='c007'>As already stated, every order was covered by a contract between
the War Office on the one hand and the four civilian members of
the Committee on the other, for the carrying out of which the
civilian members were collectively and individually responsible.
When they resigned office a statement, which was prepared and
duly audited showing the total cost, together with the surplus based
on prices agreed upon and covered by contracts between the War
Office and the four civilian members, showed that the contracts
entered into amounted in all to $345,222,874.34. Approximately
87½ per cent. of these orders were then completed, and the
surplus—the difference between the contract price and the cost of
production—was $42,097,584.57, less overhead charges, cost of
inspection, guages, etc., of $737,400.31. If 12½ per cent. be added
to this overhead charge to meet similar expenses incidental to the
completion of the contracts, $92,175.03 would require to be added,
making the total overhead expenditure $829,575.34, or a total
net surplus to the credit of the Committee on November 30, 1915,
of $41,268,009.23. The total overhead cost, covering inspection,
cost of guages, accounting, and office expense of the Committee,
worked out at&nbsp;.17, or less than one-fifth of one per cent. of contract
prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection it may be stated that the prices paid by the
War Office to American makers in many cases were considerably
higher than those paid in Canada for shells and other material. In
other cases, where the prices were approximately the same, the
volume of orders entrusted to the United States makers were very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>much greater than the corresponding orders placed with the Canadian
Shell Committee, and the American prices should have been
considerably lower. Further, the orders placed in the United
States were entrusted to an agent, who is reported to have received
a handsome commission, whereas the services of the Canadian Shell
Committee were freely given.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early stages the executive work of the Committee was
carried on by General Bertram, whose time was largely taken up in
co-ordinating the machining of parts, and the placing of orders
for components among Canadian manufacturers, while Thomas
Cantley undertook to carry out experiments, both chemical and
physical, looking to the production of open hearth basic steel to
meet the specifications and tests called for by the War Office.
Experiments were also carried out later in regard to steel discs, base
plates, nose plugs, alloy steel armor plating, etc. Later Colonel
Bertram, Thos. Cantley and G. W. Watts collaborated in fixing
prices for component parts and machining and assembling of the
different size shells. Later they devised a complete system of
records, inspection sheets, transfer and shipping forms, store and
stock forms, and a complete system of accounting was worked out
and inaugurated by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in September the Minister of Militia, on the suggestion of
the Committee, approved the appointment of David Carnegie as
Ordnance Adviser to the Committee, in view of the fact that he had
had considerable experience in munition work at Woolwich Arsenal.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the War Office first appealed to Canada for assistance in
supplying munitions, little was known of shell manufacturing in
Canada. This being the case the Canadian Government decided that
a Committee of Manufacturers could better serve the War Office
than could the Government through any of the Departments; and
then followed the formation of the Shell Committee as originally
outlined. The Committee had before them three problems: First,
that of securing steel of the requisite character; secondly, the forging
of the steel into shell bodies, together with the supply of other
component parts, comprising brass, copper, tin, zinc and antimony;
and thirdly, the machining and assembling of these various component
parts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Up to the time that the request came from the War Office
practically no men in Canada, with the exception of those employed
at the Dominion Arsenal, knew anything about the manufacture of
shells, or the material required for same. The steel hitherto used
at the Dominion Arsenal had been supplied by the Crucible Steel Co.
of America, and the War Office had stipulated that only Acid Open
Hearth Siemens-Martin steel could be employed in shell forgings.
As no Siemens-Martin steel was produced in Canada, and if the
War Office adhered to their stipulation in that respect the entire
steel supply would have to be obtained in the United States, the
American makers, feeling sure that this would be done, promptly
advanced their prices approximately forty per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture the Minister of Militia appealed to Thomas
Cantley, then President and General Manager of the Nova Scotia
Steel and Coal Co., as to whether the Scotia plant could not produce
steel which would meet not only the chemical but physical requirements
of the War Office shell specifications. He at once expressed
the belief that they could do so, and immediately proceeded to carry
out exhaustive experiments, both chemical and physical, which
proved conclusively that the Scotia Company could produce steel as
called for by the War Office, and offered to supply it at a price as
low as the original price asked by the American works, and indeed
below the American price. Within a few days of receipt of the
first order by the Shell Committee from the War Office, the Scotia
Company supplied the Committee with steel for 200,000 shrapnel
shells. The difference in price paid to the Scotia Company and
the price asked by the American Co. for the steel supplied on this
small order amounted to over $40,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards forging of shells, the cost of producing the various
component parts, the labor involved in finishing and assembling these—the
Committee were supplied with the cost of these various operations
as carried on at the Dominion Arsenal, but the difficulty involved
was that the work, having been done there by a class of
machine not in general use in Canada, and with the comparatively
small order in hand, manufacturers could not be found who would
purchase and install plant for this work and turn out shells within
a reasonable time and price.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Manufacturers throughout the country were invited to visit the
Dominion Arsenal at Quebec, where they would be shown the various
operations involved, and given all information <em>re</em> cost, methods employed,
etc. Quite a number responded to this invitation. Some
offered to undertake the work; others declined to undertake it on
any basis whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Bertram volunteered that the John Bertram &amp; Sons Co.
would do a certain amount of machining and assembling, and Thos.
Cantley, through his Company, the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Co.,
undertook to supply the steel and forgings, while Mr. Watt, of the
Canadian General Electric Company, agreed to make some of the
component parts. Sir Thomas Shaughnessy, on being appealed to
by the Committee for assistance, instructed the Superintendent of
the Angus Shops to take on some of the work, and generously
promised that the Angus Shops would take up their share of the
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the start made by these firms to encourage them, a few
other manufacturers were induced to take up a share of the work,
and thus the supply of components parts and machining of same for
the first 200,000 shells was finally placed, and this initial order was
shipped complete and to the entire satisfaction of the War Office
some considerable time before the contract date.</p>

<p class='c007'>So soon as the work involved in the first trial order had been
accepted by the manufacturers referred to, the Committee took up
the organization necessary for the co-ordinating of the work on a
larger scale; and as large orders were received in rapid succession
from the War Office, contracts were made with different manufacturers
for component parts, which were bought outright by the Committee.
A full set of component parts for each shell was supplied by
the assembly contractors, by whom these were finished and returned
as completed shells, they being paid a fixed price on the shells which
were completed, and which passed all the tests demanded by the War
Office, and were certified as such by the Government Inspection
Bureau. The component parts before being accepted by the Committee
and delivered to the finishing contractors were inspected and
certified by the Committee’s inspectors. Any component parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>spoiled by the assembly manufacturers had to be paid for by them
at the actual cost of same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first experiences of the forging and finishing contractors
alike were disappointing. It was an entirely new business to everybody
engaged in the work, and the usual initial difficulties were met
and overcome with varying success.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is safe to say that as far as the first order of 200,000 shells was
concerned, the companies engaged, either as makers of component
parts or as assembly contractors, received little, if any, profit for
their work. They had only the usual reward that comes to pioneers
in any new work.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the new and larger orders came in, both the material and
the work were thrown open to competition. The Dominion Steel
Corporation, the Steel Company of Canada, and other smaller steel
producers were asked to supply steel and forgings. The same thing
applied to manufacturing establishments, which were in a position
to supply other component parts or to take on the work of machining
and assembling. By the early part of 1915 the work was distributed
throughout the entire Dominion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who had done the pioneering work, and who won their
position through dearly-bought experience, and by venturing in where
others lacked courage to do so, came under criticism from others
who had not hitherto undertaken any of the work. To overcome
this difficulty and to assure hearty co-operation in the production
of the largest amount of munitions possible, the Committee adopted
the principle of naming a flat price for each component part, as well
as for the machining and assembling of each size shell.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the orders placed thereafter, from time to time, were placed
at a uniform price, both for the component parts and for the finishing
of the shells. The instant effect of this was that the accumulated
experience of the pioneering firms was placed at the disposal
of the other manufacturers. Both forging and finishing shops were
thrown open, their methods of working and costs were fully explained,
and shown to other manufacturers. The newcomers thus
saved the heavy cost of experimental work.</p>

<p class='c007'>New methods, improvements of great value in connection with
the execution of the work, the outcome of the initiative adaptability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of Canadians, wrought a revolution in the methods of production.
All these improvements were in every case put within the reach of
other manufacturers. Many of these have been adopted, not only
by Canadian shell makers, but by shell makers in the United States
and Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the organization period from September, 1914, to April,
1915, more than one member of the Committee worked from ten to
seventeen hours per day, Sundays and holidays not excepted, and
none of the members then appointed received one dollar by way of
remuneration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The part played by the New Glasgow works of the Nova Scotia
Steel and Coal Company in the Great War is an interesting one. At
the beginning of hostilities in August, 1914, there were only two
Steel Companies in the United States who had either the plant or
experience to produce either shells or armor plates, while none of
the Canadian steel plants had any experience whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first production of munition material, by way of shells and
shell steel, was undertaken in Canada by the Shell Committee, and
the story of the experiments carried on in the early days of September,
1914, which resulted in convincing the British War Office
that basic steel, as made in Canada, would meet all the requirements
of both shrapnel and high explosive shells, and which resulted in
very large orders for munitions coming to Canada, is well known to
all Nova Scotians, and has become a matter of history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between October, 1914, when the Scotia plants produced 22,000
shell forgings, and the signing of the Armistice, November 11, 1918,
the New Glasgow plant had made more than 15,000,000 shells—these
ranging in size from the 15–pounder shrapnel to 12–inch high
explosive, the local plant being the only one in Canada which made
the latter size. The total tonnage of forged shells produced at New
Glasgow amounted in round figures to 180,000 tons. In addition to
this a very considerable tonnage of shell and other munition steel
was shipped to be worked up in other shell forging establishments
in Canada and Great Britain. A further considerable tonnage was
worked up into marine forgings. British shipyards about this time
experienced great difficulty in obtaining heavy marine forgings to
meet Lloyd’s specification and tests. The Scotia forges had long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>been on Lloyd’s list as approved makers of Marine Forgings. The
British shipbuilders’ difficulty was now met by Scotia, which supplied
to various yards on the Clyde, the East Coast, and other yards
complete sets of marine forgings of all classes for both mercantile
and other vessels of large tonnage. The total quantity of marine
forgings supplied Great Britain since the outbreak of war amounted
to 9,000 tons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most Nova Scotians are probably entirely ignorant of the considerable
amount of what might be called “research” and experimental
work carried out at the New Glasgow plant for the Government,
and while this did not produce the tangible results brought
about in connection with the manufacture of shells, not a little of
the data and knowledge accumulated, contributed in a very considerable
degree to the successful development of both the offensive
and the defensive equipment of the Allied forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this work was being done secrecy was essential, nothing
was said and but little known of the work carried on along these
lines. Now that the War is over the necessity for secrecy appears
to be past.</p>

<p class='c007'>In February, 1919, the firm of William Beardmore and Co., of
Glasgow, Scotland, in their works magazine, told the story of the
evolution and development by them of bullet-proof material for
the protection of armored cars, trench shields, armor-plate for the
celebrated “tanks,” and other work of a like character. The story,
as told by the Beardmore people, in many important particulars
runs on all fours with the experiments and results obtained at New
Glasgow during the latter weeks of 1914 and the early part of 1915,
when a series of exhaustive experiments were carried out at New
Glasgow, first in connection with the production and testing of
bullet-resisting steel plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>This matter was first brought to the attention of the writer by
General Sir Sam Hughes in connection with the shield shovel, of
which a good deal was heard during 1915 and 1916. This spade,
as supplied by the American makers, was formed with a sharp
cutting edge, and a loophole for a rifle, but had no handle. When
deliveries began to be made by the American manufacturers, a
certain quantity was collected at random and turned over to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>writer for testing. This was carried out at the rifle range, of the
Fifth Royal Highlanders in the basement of the Bleury Street
Armory, Montreal. It was then found that while practically all
would stand Mark Six British Service Ammunition, they failed to
withstand the much greater impact of Mark Seven Ammunition.
Mark Six had a muzzle velocity of about 1,800 feet per second.
Further investigation showed that the difference in bullet resisting
power in the plates submitted was due to lack of uniformity.</p>

<p class='c007'>No handles had been supplied with the shovels, and no apparent
effort had been made by the manufacturers to supply one which
was suitable. Scotia’s engineers were asked to meet the difficulty,
which they did, and finally offered one which was adopted, weighed
eight ounces, and was secured by a single rivet passing through a
square slotted hole in the body of the shovel below the base of the
tang.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time the question of supplying our army with armored
machine-gun automobile trucks had become a pressing matter. The
question had been turned over to a Toronto Committee. Great
delay was experienced in securing sufficient suitable bullet-resisting
plate, and serious confusion resulted. The experiments in connection
with the shovel had thrown great doubt on the efficiency
of the steel being supplied by the Americans, and again the Scotia
Company were asked to carry out tests and advise as to the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>From hints which had filtered through from the army in France
and Flanders it was known that the German Spitzer bullet was much
more effective than the British new Mark Seven, and while the
armor-plating contracted to be supplied by the Americans for these
cars was guaranteed to withstand Mark Seven British Ammunition
at 300 yards, the rumors in regard to the penetrating powers of the
German Spitzer ammunition were most disquieting, and could not
be ignored.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time the United States were neutral, but were making
ammunition for the Allies and others. By methods, which it is not
necessary here to refer to, or explain, the General Manager of the
Scotia Company was able to obtain a German Mauser Service Rifle,
and by an expenditure out of all proportion to the real value,
1,000 rounds of German Mauser Spitzer service ammunition was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>also secured. An improvised range was set up on the ice on the
East River, Nova Scotia, at a point where, protected by steep banks,
firing tests could be carried out, when it was demonstrated that .311
Spitzer German ammunition, which, carefully chronographed, gave
a muzzle velocity of 2,915 feet per second, easily penetrated the
armor plate which resisted Mark Seven British Ammunition fired
from either the Lee-Enfield or Ross Rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect, of course, was to call a halt to the manufacture of
these plates, and at the same time to push forward experiments then
under way in the production by the Scotia Company of bullet-resisting
alloy armor plates. Within a short time New Glasgow was able
to offer the Department of Militia alloy steel, heat-treated plates, not
exceeding 3–16th of an inch thick, which successfully withstood
point-blank impact at one yard from Mark 7 ammunition fired from
the latest model Ross rifle. In one case two shots had struck the
plate within less than one-half inch of each other, and they neither
penetrated nor cracked the plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plates somewhat thicker were later supplied which withstood
German Mauser ammunition at point blank range, and the result
given by these plates when tested at the Proving Station in Toronto
were so satisfactory that the Artillery Proving Officers, after the
tests, placed them on exhibition outside the Camp, and later reported
that the men felt the utmost confidence with the protection afforded
them by this plating, which later was supplied and fitted to a proportion
of the machine-gun trucks then being equipped. Later the
British Government asked the Scotia Company to tender for similar
protective plating for armored trucks.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br /> <em>DEMOBILIZATION.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Demobilization, following a war of such length and
intensity as that of the Four Years’ War from August, 1914,
to November, 1918, is not a mere problem of repatriation, it
is a problem of reconstruction—a gigantic one at that—desiderating
the undivided efforts of every organization in the nation and the
assistance of every citizen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider for a moment what had happened in the industrial
world. During the four years of war, Governments were the
chief employers of men, the chief purchasers of raw materials, and
the chief sources of revenue for an overwhelmingly large portion of
the population. To retain the ideals of democracy Governments
were given unlimited power—power which was utilized in organizing
practically the entire life of the belligerent nations into a vast
machine for turning out implements of war. Not only was this
war-time industry mobilized under unified control, but the market
for which its product was turned out could not be flooded. Indeed,
it continually called for greater and greater production regardless of
cost. The expansion of business, and the building up of a huge
army of war workers, the scarcity of labor and raw materials, the
shifting of markets, the meteoric rise of prices, the less rapid rise
of wages, Government control of prices, raw materials and exports,
the inflation of currency, the huge increase in national debts—these
were some of the phenomena which characterized the period. They
justify the assertion that a revolution in the economic and industrial
life of the nations had occurred. Even in Canada, remote from the
scene of actual strife, a generation’s changes were compressed into
four short years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then suddenly, on November the eleventh, the object for which
the vast war machine had been built up was attained. The necessity
for its existence vanished over-night, and the world found itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>face to face with the task of scrapping the industrial machine which
had so effectively served the requirements of war, and of rebuilding
one which would serve just as effectively the entirely different
requirements of peace. The new task was more difficult than the
old, and had to be accomplished in a much shorter period—a few
months, instead of four years. Again, the problems themselves
were more delicate and intricate; largely problems of human
psychology, not of mechanics, requiring for their solution not compulsion,
but education, persuasion and co-operation. The world
has learned that it is much easier to make war than to make peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early days of 1914 and 1915 were days of mobilization
problems, and they were problems indeed. The provision of arms,
equipment and food had to be undertaken on a scale unheard of
before. It was necessary to provide transportation for vast bodies
of troops and great quantities of stores, to say nothing of the construction
of training camps, rifle ranges, and all the paraphernalia
of war. The human element, fresh and easily responsive to
patriotic appeal, presented few difficulties at that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, however, certain conditions inherent in military life
which go far towards unfitting the soldier for civilian occupation.
Without entering into a discussion of the reasons for these conditions,
two of them at least may be enumerated. In military life
individual liberty is impossible, but it is of supreme importance in
civil life. Further, in military life ambition or self-interest, which
may be considered a fundamental motive in human action, becomes
of secondary importance. Self-interest is, in fact, disciplined into
complete abeyance. The moment the soldier becomes a civilian the
restraints upon his individual liberty are more or less removed, and
it is entirely in keeping with the impulses of human nature if he
should, for a time, go to the opposite extreme. Then again, he
finds it no easy task to awaken the ambition lying dormant within
him, and it frequently happens that it is only from bitter experience
that he learns it is necessary to rely, in the first instance, upon himself.
These two conditions alone emphasize how different are the
various problems of demobilization and mobilization. The success
or failure of the work of reconstruction depends, not so much on
the highly-developed organization as on the amount of personal
service, whole-hearted sympathy and understanding brought to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>work by those who, together with the soldier, must face the many
obstacles confronting him in the first stages of his return to citizenship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without the active co-operation of the soldiers themselves the
work of reconstruction could not be a success. Undoubtedly our
present stability, in comparison with many other parts of Canada is,
in a large measure, due to the initiative and strength of purpose with
which our soldiers have met, and are meeting, the tasks of a humdrum
every-day life. It would, no doubt, be surprising to the
average citizen were he to know how many men in Nova Scotia
have re-established themselves without assistance from the Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until the closing days of 1915 and the return of
casualties gassed and wounded from Ypres, Festubert, and
Givenchy, that the problems of demobilization began to press for
attention. The country was sadly lacking in proper hospital accommodation
and equipment, especially for the treatment of surgical
cases. The disabled man was finding it no easy matter to re-establish
himself and the provision of industrial training or suitable employment
for him was an urgent need. In many other ways the
necessity for a radical change made itself apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The actual work of getting the soldiers home and out of khaki
was in the hands of the Department of Militia and Defence; but
the methods of peace and war are as far removed as day and night,
and it was soon recognized that the re-absorption of returned
soldiers into civil life, with the least disturbance of economic conditions,
could not be best performed by an organization of the military
type. The first step in the direction of providing a suitable
organization was taken when the Military Hospitals Commission
was formed in the same year. The duties of this Commission
eventually embraced almost every phase of the problem of demobilization,
from the provision of hospitals, convalescent homes and
treatment, to vocational re-education for those who, through a
disability were unable to return to their former occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not all the emergencies were, of course, foreseen; and from
time to time changes for the better were made in the regulations.
Shortly after the formation of the Commission a conference of
representatives from the various Provincial Governments was called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>at Ottawa, and the suggestions there adopted involved an extension
of the work by the appointment of a sub-committee of the Federal
Commission in each Province, to assume the responsibility of finding
employment for discharged soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately following this conference the Returned Soldiers’
Employment Committee of Nova Scotia, or, as it was afterwards
known, the Nova Scotia Returned Soldiers’ Commission, was
appointed. The importance of this work at the time could not be
overestimated, for is not reconstruction fundamentally a problem of
employment and employment conditions? This function, however,
by no means exhausted the activities of the Provincial Commission.
On executive questions of a local nature it was the advisory body of
the Federal Commission at Ottawa, and its scope was extended as
the need arose, until it embraced practically all matters dealing
with returned men. On certain occasions the Commission maintained
an early and aggressive stand on problems which were not
merely of a local character, but which affected the economic life of
the Dominion.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Military Hospitals Commission was formed, it was
found necessary to operate Interviewing Departments in conjunction
with the Clearing or Discharge Depots at Halifax, St. John and
Quebec, in order to secure information from which to compile
records. Each returning soldier on the ship’s nominal roll was questioned
regarding his pre-war occupation, his future prospects and
intentions, as well as other general information required. In the
case of casualties the proceedings of the last medical board were also
secured. At Halifax a Staff of returned men were engaged in
this work under the supervision of W. B. MacCoy, Secretary of the
Provincial Commission. As the interviewing for the whole of
Canada was performed at the ports, it can be appreciated what a
vast amount of work this entailed, particularly when handling
hospital ships. The severely disabled men were, of course, unable
to visit the Interviewing Department. Consequently it was not
possible to proceed as rapidly as in the case of ordinary transports.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another detail of the disembarkation which involved a great
deal of work on the part of the Commission was that of notifying the
next-of-kin of returning soldiers. A copy of the Nominal Roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>prepared on the voyage across, was secured immediately after the
ship had docked and the Secretaries of the Returned Soldiers’ Commissions
in the various other Provinces were telegraphed a complete
list of the men going forward with the names and addresses of
their relatives or friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nova Scotia men were, of course, dealt with first, as in
many cases they would arrive home within a few hours. Their
names were either telegraphed or telephoned to the Secretaries of
the Town Reception Committees who, in turn, notified the relatives
and aided in providing a suitable reception.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the War, Nova Scotia was exceedingly fortunate in the
matter of employment. The number of unemployed soldiers seldom
averaged more than ten per cent., and was usually between two and
seven per cent. However, the abnormal conditions prevailing after
the signing of the Armistice rendered the number of placements by
the Commission, for a time at least, almost negligible. Numbers of
men were suddenly thrown on the labor market by the closing of
war-time industries, while at the same time our soldiers were being
returned in thousands. This was by no means the critical period.
Many of the men returning after years of service Overseas felt
the need of a well-earned vacation more than they did of a job,
while those who had dependants and who were anxious, but unable,
to secure immediate employment, were temporarily provided for by
the war service gratuity. For the majority, the most anxious time
arrived during the succeeding fall and winter months. It is not
the intention, however, to deal with the employment activities of
the Commission. Attention must be confined to work of a more
general nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>As previously stated, the country, particularly Nova Scotia,
was sadly lacking in hospital accommodation. In the spring and
early summer of 1915, nearly all returned soldiers either came
through the Port of Quebec, or, if disembarked at Halifax, were
forwarded to the Discharge Depot there. Save in a few instances,
such as severe casualties, these men as soon as medically examined
were given transportation to their homes. Discharge Certificates
were usually not issued for months after their return, and a great
deal of confusion resulted. Indeed, few of the men were aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>of their status, and it not infrequently happened that, instead of
the longed-for piece of parchment, they received a letter from their
Military District instructing them to report for duty,—this after
having perhaps accepted civilian employment. The uncertainty of
their future added to the difficulties of obtaining a satisfactory
position, for after a few experiences, employers generally hesitated
to engage a man who was not in possession of a certificate releasing
him to civilian duties. As time went on, too, pay complaints began
to pour in by the score, due no doubt to an antiquated system of
handling documents, and the poor working facilities afforded the
District Pay Staffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the end of the following year the Provincial Commission
advised the erection of a hospital, but although the officials of the
Military Hospitals Commission apparently concurred in the Provincial
Commission’s views, the conditions remained unchanged.
Repeated reports were made by the Secretary and concrete cases
submitted, showing the necessity in certain instances for providing
treatment. The situation became so acute that at a meeting of the
local Commission, held on February 21, 1917, certain members,
feeling that the existing state of affairs might be construed as reflecting
upon them, tendered their resignations to the Chairman.
These resignations were, however, held in abeyance for a few days,
and a strongly-worded resolution was passed and forwarded to Sir
James Lougheed. Several days later a special meeting was called
at the request of the Director of the Military Hospitals Commission,
at which were present two officials of that body with full authority
to take what steps were deemed necessary in order to relieve the
situation. The writer, who has had access to the correspondence
and records, can state without fear of contradiction, that it was
wholly due to the efforts of the Provincial Commission that Camp
Hill Hospital was erected in 1917. Readers who are familiar with
conditions both then and during the period following the Halifax
disaster must realize what a boon it was to have had this splendid
institution awaiting any and all emergencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of Vocational Training was one in which the Commission
took a deep interest from the very first. One of its early
steps was to institute a careful survey of all existing educational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>facilities throughout Nova Scotia, which could be used for the re-education
of disabled men. The re-training of this class was of the
utmost importance, and the Commission successfully fought for the
enactment of several regulations tending to broaden the scope of
the Vocational Department.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most persistent efforts was made in the interest of
the physically fit “boy soldier.” Aside from the minor who had
been disabled, no provision existed whereby these young boys could
be afforded the opportunities of re-education or re-training. The
need for this was foreseen by the Provincial Office some two years
before the close of the War and no opportunity was lost in the
furtherance of their proposal to place them on the same footing
as the disabled man. It was most desirable to provide facilities
for the education of these young soldiers who enlisted in the Forces
at an immature age. Their decision was made at a time when they
could not probably measure the consequences of their act, and for
this reason the public was responsible for any disadvantages accruing
to them. The years spent in the army were just those during which
they should have been fitting themselves to win a position of self-support
and independence; and it is not only an advantage to themselves,
but to the country, that they have been assisted in preparing
for the earning of a livelihood rather than having been forced into
the ranks of unskilled labor. The step taken by the Government in
the early part of last year was indeed satisfactory in consideration
of the initial and continuous efforts of the Provincial Commission.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Soldier Settlement Act, passed in 1917, has proved to be
one of the most satisfactory measures of re-establishment provided
by the Government. As originally framed, however, it was of very
little value to a man who desired to go on the land in the Maritime
Provinces. The free grants provided by the Act were restricted
to Dominion Lands, while here any land of value for agricultural
purposes is privately owned. This was clearly placing under a
handicap the Nova Scotian soldier who wished to stay in his
native Province, inasmuch as the maximum amount which could
be borrowed under the Act was only $2,500. The Provincial Commission
urged very strongly that the benefits to be derived should
be equally distributed and enjoyed by soldiers wishing to go on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the land in any Province. At the 1918 yearly meeting of Provincial
Secretaries, held at Ottawa, the other Provinces were unanimous in
supporting the Maritime representatives, and a resolution was passed
petitioning the Federal Government to extend the provisions of the
Act. This was done some time afterwards, and to-day we have in
Nova Scotia some three hundred and fifty farms producing, and as
many soldiers re-established in this way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The months which followed the erection of Camp Hill Hospital
brought many changes. The Military Hospitals Commission ceased
and was succeeded by the Department of Soldiers’ Civil Re-Establishment.
New organizations arose, and new methods were inaugurated
in old ones to meet the constantly increasing needs and changing
problems. But space will not permit to deal with all the phases of
this many-sided and deeply interesting work. At best details can
only be touched upon, and the three instances quoted of the Commission’s
connection with the larger problems of reconstruction by
no means exhausts an interesting store of past events. The
part taken by W. B. MacCoy, K.C.,
Secretary of the Commission, is deserving
of the fullest public recognition. No
man has been more sincere or more
zealous in safeguarding the interests of
the Nova Scotian soldiers. His work
was not undertaken without a sacrifice,
but the appreciation of thousands of
soldiers and dependants expressed in the
letters of thanks contained on the fyles
of the Commission, and in many other
ways, has doubtless repaid him in full.</p>

<p class='c007'>Victory was the reward of loyalty and
co-operation and the willingness of each and every soldier to
subjugate self in the welfare of the whole, and play the game as
best he could. Demobilization has required no less devotion, energy,
and co-operation than did the War itself and the measure of success
attained through the sympathy, tact, and ability displayed by however
humble a servant in the great work of reconstruction will be
reflected in the national life of Canada for the next generation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br /> <em>VOCATIONAL TRAINING.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The aftermath of the Great War, which virtually ended with
the Armistice on November 11, 1918, should be historically
different from the social and economic muddles and messes
which have succeeded other prolonged struggles. Human nature
has not changed, but society is more enlightened, more highly
organized, and more averse to waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soldiers who returned to Canada from the Boer War were
paid small Imperial pensions for disabilities incurred and were
rewarded by grants of land in the great Canadian West, which
almost all of them realized on immediately, selling them to “land
sharks” for ridiculously small cash sums. It has been stated that
most of the British veterans of the Crimea died in the workhouses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the last War was fought with more highly developed
death-dealing machines and apparatus, and consequently evolved
entirely new means of counter-offensive and protection, so the
Allied nations employed entirely new methods to compensate the
disabled fighting men for the incapacities they suffered through
service. The aim was to develop all of the remaining abilities and
aptitudes of the crippled soldier so that he might be able to retain
his place in civilian life as an active, independent, self-supporting
citizen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nova Scotia can justly claim the credit for starting the plan of
vocational re-training developed in Canada. In July, 1915, Miss
I. Matthews, who was assisting her sister, Mrs. J. K. L. Ross, in
preparing the residence of the latter in Sydney for use as a convalescent
home for soldiers, secured a pamphlet describing the early
efforts of France in rehabilitating war cripples. She brought it
to the attention of Hon. G. H. Murray, who asked Principal F. H.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Sexton, of the Technical College, for some concrete practical suggestions.
The latter prepared a careful report on the methods
which the Dominion might use to organize this work, and this was
submitted to the Premier of Canada, Sir Robert Borden.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_331.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>DR. F. H. SEXTON,<br />Principal Nova Scotia Technical College.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Just before this there had been created the Military Hospitals
Commission to control the treatment in Canada of wounded and
disabled men returning from Europe. The report on vocational
re-training was submitted to the Commission for consideration and
action. The subject was regarded of such importance that a conference
of Provincial Premiers and other representatives was called
to consider this and some other questions affecting returned men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Principal Sexton was sent as a Nova Scotian delegate to this
conference and explained his ideas. He asserted that nearly all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>maimed and crippled men could be put on their feet again as wage-earners
by a short, practical, intensive course in vocational training.
The men were adults who had already had some industrial experience
and consequently would not need as much or as long training
as youths being apprenticed in trades. During the last twenty-five
years industry had been sub-divided into many specialized occupations,
in many of which little physical effort was required.
Advantage could be taken of the vocational experience of the
soldier previous to enlistment and, in most cases, he could be trained
for some occupation in the same industry where his disability would
not be a handicap. That is, the crippled men could be moved side-wise
in industry to some parallel occupation or, by means of a little
education, could be lifted up higher and fitted for some supervisory
position as boss, foreman, or superintendent. Thus, a structural
steel worker, with some physical deficiency, would be trained for a
position of draftsman. The coal miner, who was disabled, so that
he could no longer dig coal at the face could, in a comparatively
short time, be trained for the position of shot-firer, fire boss, mine
examiner, overman, underground foreman, or mine manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were endless opportunities for fitting men for occupations
that required more technical knowledge, more skill, and more
mental capacity. Most of the Canadian soldiers had not much
opportunity for vocational education in their youth, and the great
majority could be prepared for better jobs with their disability than
they had been able to qualify for before they enlisted. It was
pointed out that technical schools could offer some courses for
disabled men, and that the rest of them could be given intensive
short apprenticeships in industry. The disabled men and their
families should be supported in respectability during the course of
training. It was emphasized that the soldier in the hospital should
begin to do some work as soon as possible, so that he would not
lose his habits of industry by too prolonged an idleness during
treatment. This method of technical education would be expensive,
but it would more than repay the country by making almost all
the disabled men competent to maintain themselves as wage-earners
for the remainder of their lives, and eliminate the great proportion
of indigent, idle pensioners that had succeeded other great wars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The conference in September, 1915, enthusiastically recommended
that the Military Hospitals Commission proceed to develop
vocational training of disabled soldiers along the lines proposed.
Soon after this steps were taken to put the suggestions into actual
practice. Principal Sexton was appointed, under the Commission,
as Vocational Officer for Quebec and the Maritime Provinces,
which office he has held for four and one-half years.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the convalescent hospitals were first opened in Canada,
it was thought at first that all the men needed was the necessary
medical treatment and a rest and then most of them would naturally
return to work. People who had not had army training, and who
had not endured the terrible experiences in the front line trenches,
did not understand the psychological reversal most of the soldiers
had suffered. The ordinary Canadian was noted for his power
of initiative. In times of peace he had developed resourcefulness
and individuality. From thousands of occupations our men donned
the khaki uniform. The first great lesson for the new soldier was
that of implicit obedience to his superior officers. He was instructed
that others would do his thinking for him. The responsibility of
providing food, shelter, and raiment for himself and his dependants,
which had been his constant effort in waking hours, was lifted from
his shoulders. His habits were regularized to conform to a single
standard,—that of the well-disciplined soldier. In action he was
forced into a condition of personal dirtiness that would have been
absolutely repellent to him in ordinary life. He was subjected
to the nerve-racking, soul-splitting ordeal of continuous fire of high
explosives. Death lurked at his elbow continuously in a thousand
hideous forms. He lived like a worm, and the taking and giving of
human life became an hourly experience. He forgot what a normal
mode of living was like, and his tours back and forth to the trenches
seemed the whole of existence, with only a ghastly way out of it.
Then came his “blighty,” and the long, painful period of hospital
experience where willing and loving hands ministered to every need.
He was doctored, nursed and entertained lavishly. Is it any wonder
that he found himself in an abnormal mental state, and that ordinary
civilian life seemed petty and cold and humdrum? Is it surprising
that he found himself slow to rouse himself and prepare to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>up again some civilian task in the treadmill of industry which would
reward him with only food, clothing and lodging? After the
glorious comradeship with his fellows in facing death, the competitive
system in a life of routine duties seemed dull and deadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed evident from the first experience that work was the
only panacea. Definite, interesting occupation alone offered the
means of making the man forget himself, and of wrenching him
around into the footpath of peace. Self-imposed routine duties of
an absorbing nature provided the necessary attraction and distraction
to enable the man to prepare himself again for a useful life in
industry. Therefore interesting work of all kinds was provided to
suit different abilities and disabilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three divisions of the work of re-training the disabled soldier
developed as progress was made with this task, viz.: (1) Ward
Occupations; (2) Curative Workshops; (3) Industrial Re-training.
These will be taken up in the order named.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <span class='sc'>Ward Occupations.</span> Basketry, weaving, leather work
and other handicrafts were taught to the men in hospital right in
the wards, as recreational activity, during the time of convalescence
when the soldiers, as patients, are not advanced far enough
in their recovery to leave their beds or to take up serious education.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <span class='sc'>Curative Workshops.</span> Every hospital had either a
separate vocational building or a portion of its space set aside for
curative workshops. Here were held a variety of classes for men
taking treatment who were able to leave their wards and who
wished to study some subjects which would be of advantage to
them when they were discharged from hospital and would re-enter
civilian life or take up training for a new occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <span class='sc'>Industrial Re-Training.</span> This was the most important
division of the work and, in fact, constituted the main
activity of the Vocational Branch of the Department of Soldiers’
Civil Re-establishment. All soldiers who received a disability in
military service through disease, accident or wounds which prevented
them from returning to their old occupations, were entitled to
industrial re-training. Any man who enlisted under the age of
eighteen, and whose apprenticeship or training for some useful
occupation was seriously interrupted by the War, was also entitled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>to an industrial re-training course. Thousands of men had to be
intensively trained for hundreds of different occupations in the
shortest possible time. During their courses they and their
dependants received pay and allowances to support themselves.
Every kind of institution which offered definite vocational training
was utilized, but a great proportion of the men were placed in
industry itself to learn their new occupations. Special trade classes
and schools had to be organized and equipped by the Department
of Soldiers’ Civil Re-establishment to meet the new need. The
main aim was to train the disabled soldiers and minors in six to
ten months, so that they could earn the prevailing wage in suitable
vocations. This aim was realized with results that have amply
justified the predictions of experts in industrial education and the
enormous expenditure of money necessary. The development of
the three main divisions of the vocational work in Nova Scotia
is interesting and illuminating, and promises much for the future
in pointing the way to further developments in our hospital treatment
and the reclaiming of the productive power of our men who
have been or will be crippled by accident or disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very evident from the first experience with returned
disabled soldiers in Canadian convalescent hospitals, that they
needed some definite work to engage their attention just as soon
as they were able to do it. After a prolonged illness their morale
was very low, and many were convinced that they were so badly
disabled that they would never be good for anything again. Nerves,
muscles, and tendons which had been seriously damaged by wounds,
could be healed and brought back to part of their former power
by operative treatment, massage, electric therapy, etc., but at a
certain stage further improvement could take place only through
the action of the <em>will</em> of the patient. At this point the soldier
will try to make his damaged body function properly if he is
absorbed in some interesting task.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consequently, handicraft work was introduced into the hospitals
under the title of ward occupations. In the summer of 1917
volunteers from the V.A.D. of the St. John Ambulance Association
were trained in different handicrafts at the Nova Scotia
Technical College, and gave their services to the patients at Camp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Hill and Pine Hill Hospitals. The value of the work soon became
apparent, and a central training school for ward aides, as the
handicraft teachers were called, was opened in Toronto. Young
women of education, character, and aptitude were carefully selected
for this work, and as soon as they had been given training, they
were placed in every military hospital and sanitarium. They co-operated
with the medical officers and nursing sisters in every
particular, and a combined effort was made to get every patient
busy at some kind of work just as soon as he was able to do anything.
Basketry, weaving, embroidery, leather tooling, raffia work,
toy-making, wood carving, art craft, metal work, and other forms
of occupation were provided. The chief difficulty was in first getting
the individual interested; and this task took an immense amount
of tact and persuasion in some instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The underlying motive was to divert the man’s mind from its
morbid state and to give him a mental stimulus back toward civilian
life. In the majority of cases, the patient would make artistic
objects for his relatives and friends. If he wished to keep the
articles he merely paid for the cost of the material, but if he did
not want them the Vocational Branch offered them for sale at a
fair commercial value, deducted the cost of raw materials and
gave the balance to the patient. There was no idea of instructing
the men in gainful trades Which they could follow after their
discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Too high a tribute cannot be paid to the high character and
ability and the unflagging devotion of the Nova Scotia Ward
Aides. They gave the same high form of unselfish, patriotic
service that was characteristic of the best groups of women workers.
The ward occupations were of enormous benefit in making the
weary hours of the days pass quickly, in improving the discipline
in the institutions, and in materially shortening the time of treatment
in many cases. The handicraft work has been specially
developed for insane patients, and helps to fill the pathetic lives of
the soldiers confined in the Nova Scotia Hospital for the Insane.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large proportion of the men in the institutions were not
confined to their wards. Their disabilities were such, or they had
reached such an advanced stage in their treatment, that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>able to move about and to perform light work. For these cases
there was only a half-hour a day of treatment, and the rest of the
time might be spent in playing cards, in reading magazines, or in
sheer idleness. There was great danger that the men might become
“hospitalized” and unfitted for the stern tasks of industrial life.
Therefore, curative workshops were provided, where a wide range
of classes was held for six or seven hours a day. Practical and
accomplished instructors were in charge of the various branches,
and nearly every soldier, physically fit to pursue such studies, could
find something of interest and value. Many of the patients had
never had a fair chance to get a good education, and a goodly
number who had had such an opportunity had not availed themselves
of it. A few of the soldiers did not even know how to
read and write. As mechanics, most of the soldiers had acquired
such skill as they possessed in a careless and haphazard manner
and were not thoroughly competent. To suit the general needs
and tastes of the patients, instruction was offered in business
English, practical arithmetic, practical algebra, geometry and trigonometry,
bookkeeping, stenography and typewriting, telegraphy,
mechanical and architectural drafting, gardening, woodworking,
shoe repairing, automobile driving and repair, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>These adult students made amazing progress in their studies.
Those who had forgotten all their mathematics, except the first
four rules, covered years of school work in a few months, and in
going over it the second time would never again forget it. Foreigners
and men who were illiterate learned the rudiments of
arithmetic and the English language in a surprisingly short time.
Others were absorbed in the work of the different classes, and
gained valuable knowledge according to their ability and the length
of time they stayed in the hospital. For some of them, who were
not entitled to industrial re-training after discharge, it was their
only opportunity to get general or vocational education. For those
who were so disabled that they could not return to their old
occupations, the curative workshops offered a trying-out ground
where they could test their aptitudes and often lay a solid basis
for further training. It was a pathetic as well as an inspiring sight
to see some grizzled hero bringing back muscular power to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>scarred and withered arm in planing a piece of wood to make
some piece of furniture for his home. The workshop offered
practically the only method of treatment to the neurasthenic or
“shell-shocked” patient. No medicine or massage or operation
could help him, and only the stimulation of his self-interest in
class work could get him to forget himself and thus gradually
bring him back to normal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first curative workshop classes to be opened in the Dominion
started at the Ross Convalescent Hospital in Sydney, on April 4,
1916. They were rapidly developed in every hospital and sanatorium
throughout Canada, and proved of immense benefit in
helping to re-establish our disabled soldiers who received treatment
in Canada.</p>

<p class='c007'>By far the most important division of the vocational work of
civil re-establishment, however, was the industrial re-training.
France and Belgium showed the way in which crippled men could
be trained for future usefulness in suitable trades; and practically
every belligerent country evolved a system of human rehabilitation
for maimed soldiers. Canada had the advantage of time to plan
and develop her methods of dealing with this problem before she
was swamped with numbers, and consequently was able to establish
a uniform system with centralized authority. The basis of the
whole work was to give suitable training for every soldier who,
through some disability incurred in military service, could not
efficiently resume the occupation which he followed prior to
enlistment. In addition to this class, all men classed as minors,
who had enlisted under the age of eighteen, were later given training
if their war service had seriously interfered with their
preparation for their chosen occupation, whether they were disabled
or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every effort was made to place the disabled man in the right
position. He was interviewed by a sympathetic and competent
official and counselled intelligently about the important choice of a
new trade. The soldier already had industrial experience and, in
the majority of cases, had some definite idea of what he wished to
do. If his conceptions of the duties, remuneration, conditions of
work, chances for promotion, stability, etc., in the new occupation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>were wrong, he was reasonably and patiently advised to make
another choice. The disabled man, however, always made the
decision about his own future. His own wishes were followed as
far as possible, because he would make a failure of his training
and of his new occupation if he himself was not satisfied and
enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queer trait of human nature that considers “distant fields
as ever green” was much in evidence. During his former experience,
the disabled soldier had always had a conviction that some
other job completely outside of his own vocation was easier and
better paid, or that some new development of industry was holding
out its arms and screaming for workers. Consequently, there was
a common tendency to enter some vocation wholly outside of his
former experience. Most of the men were extremely reasonable
and when all the facts were put before them they made wise
decisions. Every definite effort was made to keep the man as
close as possible to the industry in which he was employed before
enlistment. If they had all tried to crowd into a few of the highly
skilled occupations, there would not have been vacancies enough
to give them all employment. So the training was made as wide
as business and industry. Schools and classes were organized and
equipped for those vocations which needed preliminary education
under skilled instructors, and for which comparatively large groups
of men were preparing. In cases where men were deficient in
general education, and needed some fundamental knowledge of
English and arithmetic in order to succeed, they were given intensive
preliminary instruction for one, two or three months before
starting specialized vocational training. Every educational institution
which offered intensive practical courses leading to wage-earning
power, was made use of to the fullest extent. Industry
itself, however, offered the widest opportunities, and a great
proportion of the students were placed directly in industry to learn
there how to fill the job acceptably under working conditions, so
that at the end of their period of training they could slip over on
the pay roll of the employer without any break. Other men, who
had preliminary training in the special trade classes established
by the Department of Soldiers’ Civil Re-establishment, were placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>in industry for the latter part of their period of education so that
they would get accustomed to workshop conditions, and in order
that there would be no appreciable hiatus between training and
employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to provide ample means for the training and employment
of the thousands of men the War produced, it was necessary
to secure the closest co-operation of the employers, trade unions,
and the general public. It is a pleasure to chronicle the fact that
everybody gave active help without stint. The Dominion Steel
Corporation and the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company, the
largest single employers of labor in Nova Scotia, announced publicly
that they would find a suitable place for every one of their former
employees who had gone into military service and who desired
work after his discharge. They carried out their promise, and
also provided every possible facility for re-training disabled men.
Trade unions also gave generous assistance, and waived all restrictions
regarding apprenticeship where these might be detrimental
to maimed and crippled soldiers who were learning new trades.
Without all this splendid co-operation, the results achieved in
Canada in re-training the disabled soldiers for future usefulness
would have been impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The usual period of time that was found necessary to put the
discharged soldiers on their feet so that they could earn the
prevailing wage in a new occupation, was seven or eight months.
During the War, when all labor was very scarce, employers would
accept men and give them full wages after about six months’ training,
but when competition became keener and more workers became
available in 1919, eight months was found to be necessary in most
cases, and sometimes even a whole year. During the period of
learning a new vocation, the soldier’s pension was suspended, and
he and his dependants received a uniform scale of pay and allowances
as follows:—</p>

<table class='table2' summary=''>

    <td class='c025'>„    „</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>If training caused the man to live apart from his dependants,
an extra allowance of $16.00 per month was granted. Owing to
the increased cost of living, these rates were advanced on September
1, 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>All classes carried on by the Department of Civil Re-establishment
in Nova Scotia were conducted for eight hours per day in
order to get the men accustomed to the conditions prevailing in
industry. Where men were sent to educational institutions, or were
apprenticed in industry, they were subject to the rules and regulations
in force at the place where they were learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scope of the work widened rapidly as it progressed until
men were being re-trained for more than 300 different occupations.
It is not necessary to give a list of these occupations, but the comprehensive
field covered may be imagined if only those classified
under the letter “A” were mentioned:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The man who was placed in industry for training or employment
was kept under constant supervision and visited every two
or three weeks to ascertain his progress. If he was not securing
proper treatment or opportunity to learn, he was moved to some
other position. If his choice of occupation had not been wise, he
was tried out in some other line of work. After he had finished
his course, he was visited at least once a month for four months
to see that his re-establishment was complete and his progress
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>The first group to receive industrial re-training in Canada
consisted of a number of unfortunate members of a British West
India Regiment. A large number were landed in Halifax in
February, 1917, from a transport and were sent to hospital to be
treated for severe frost bite. Nine of them had to have both legs
amputated and eight of them lost one leg or a portion of a leg.
Previous to enlistment these Jamaicans had been “cultivators” or
agricultural laborers, and had very little education. When their
hospital treatment was completed they were re-trained by the Vocational
Branch in Halifax. Mr. W. J. Clayton gave over his whole
residence and the Provincial Branch of the Red Cross Society
fitted it up completely for a convalescent hospital and re-training
centre. The men were given instruction in three trades suitable
to their disability, viz., tailoring, shoe repairing, and tin-smithing.
At the end of five and one-half months they were sent back to
Jamaica able to earn at least fifty per cent. more in their new
occupations than they had received before as laborers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of re-training disabled Nova Scotian soldiers began
seriously in the spring of 1917. A centre was established at the
Technical College in Halifax. It was fortunate, indeed, that the
Province had embarked on its scheme of technical education before
the War, and that this splendid institution stood ready with all its
equipment and trained Staff to render service to the men disabled
in war. The Provincial Government turned practically the whole
establishment over to the Dominion Government for this work.
Classes in garage mechanics, automobile tire vulcanizing, electricity,
mechanical, architectural and ship drafting, land surveying, machine
tool operation, stationary engineering, oxyacetylene welding, shoe
repairing, etc., were organized. The institution became a busy hive
of industry. The numbers grew until larger quarters had to be
secured for part of the classes. In the summer of 1919 a large
group of demobilization barracks on Cunard St., Halifax, was
taken over and specially fitted and equipped for educational
purposes. This was called the Borden Re-training Centre, and the
main portion of the work has been done there since that time.
A number of the classes are still maintained at the Technical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>College, and this service will be rendered by the College until the
whole task is completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of re-training students in Nova Scotia increased
rapidly in 1919 until it reached its peak with a strength of about
2,300 in March, 1920. From this number it has rapidly declined.
Altogether, in the Province, about 4,000 returned men have been
granted courses to this date. When one considers that they were
training for nearly 300 trades, and that they were being admitted
to and discharged from courses every day, that they and their
dependants must be paid twice a month, that employment must be
found for them, that they must be followed up for four months
after completing their training, and thousands of their difficulties
smoothed out, the magnitude of the task can be appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>A centre for re-training men in agriculture was established at
the Nova Scotia Agricultural College at Truro. Here again this
advantage of having a fully equipped institution, with a Staff of
highly-trained specialists ready to render service to the discharged
soldiers, cannot be overestimated. All the re-training students from
the three Maritime Provinces were sent here, because it was the
only place in this area competent to meet their needs. Special
courses adapted for the purpose were provided, and the regular
Staff of the College gave unstintingly of their time and knowledge.
Like the Technical College, the Agricultural College allowed discharged
soldiers to attend all regular courses without any tuition
fees. The number of men applying for re-training in agricultural
branches was small because most forms of farming demand physical
fitness, and the army experience of the soldiers tended to
make them wish to stick to industries in the towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Contrary to the expectations of the public, very few men were
blinded in the army. Wounds that would deprive a man of his
sight usually killed him. Out of our forces of about a half million
men, only 130 have had their vision impaired to such an extent
that they require re-training. The Canadian authorities arranged
with Sir Arthur Pearson that the blind men should all be trained
in that splendid institution, St. Dunstan’s Hostel, in London. In
the early days of the War, however, a few blinded men drifted
back to Canada without training. These were collected and about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>a dozen sent to Halifax, where they were given special instruction
under the Military Hospitals Commission at the School for the
Blind. They were taught Braille reading and writing, typewriting,
Braille stenography, massage, and shoe repairing. Most of the
men made remarkable progress, and are successfully earning their
own livings to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Altogether Canada has granted about 53,000 courses of re-training.
From the very first she has followed a sane, practical
policy, and has enjoyed the advantages of uniformity and centralized
control throughout all the Provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The results speak for themselves. In Nova Scotia 65 per cent.
of the men who have completed their courses are successfully
re-established in the occupation for which they were trained.
Another 20 per cent. are earning satisfactory wages in other lines
of work than those for which they were specifically prepared.
These men have changed because they saw better opportunities
for themselves, individually, in another vocation, or they may have
felt fit enough, after their course, to return to their old occupation.
Their training will not be lost, because they are so much more
competent because of having it. Ten per cent. of the men have gone
out of the Province and cannot be traced. It is safe to conclude
that most of these are successfully re-established. Two per cent.
of the men are reported as unemployed, but it is not known to what
extent this is due to lack of temporary opportunity or disinclination
on the part of the man. Three per cent. of the men are
reported as still ill and temporarily under treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>This high salvage among war-wrecked men can be accepted
with great satisfaction by every patriotic Canadian. Without the
loyal co-operation of every section of society and the unflagging
devotion to duty on the part of the large Staff of returned men
who were engaged in administration and instruction, these results
would have been impossible. Canada’s record of reconstruction
and her efforts to rehabilitate the brave soldiers who gave of their
youth and strength in the service of the country, stand on a par
with her military achievements.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER L.<br /> <em>THE PATRIOTIC FUND.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The Nova Scotia Branch of the Canadian Patriotic Fund
was organized in Halifax, September 2, 1914, with the
late Lieutenant-Governor Hon. James D. MacGregor as
Chairman of the Provincial Executive. On completion of his term
of office as Governor, he was succeeded by Hon. David McKeen as
Chairman, who acted to the time of his death, November 13, 1916.
On appointment to the office of Lieutenant-Governor, His Honor
MacCallum Grant became Chairman of the Executive. Other
members of the Executive who have continued in office from September,
1914, to date, are:—Hon. G. H. Murray, M.P.P., Premier
and Provincial Secretary; Hon. Chief Justice Harris, Hon. E. N.
Rhodes, M.P., the Chairman of County Branches; H. A. Flemming,
Treasurer; and Arthur S. Barnstead, B.A., LL.B., Secretary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The total amount raised and remitted to the Honorary Treasurer
to March 31, 1919, was $1,847,883.31, and to March 31,
1920, was $1,862,431.80. The total amount disbursed was to
March 31, 1919, $1,628,177.04, and to March 31, 1920, $1,726,520.30.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Central Executive arranged for the collection of the
amounts allotted to the Province in connection with the various
campaigns, and county committees co-operating. With but one
exception, every county municipality contributed to the Fund, and
practically every town of the Province made grants. In two or
three towns, private individuals made collections for the Fund
where no grant was made by the Town Council.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distribution of relief was supervised by the Provincial
Executive, requisitions being drawn by the treasurer of every county
for the money required, the list of beneficiaries being carefully
checked before the money was placed to the credit of the local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>treasurer. The result of co-operation between the Provincial Executive
and the various relief committees was so beneficial that
very little difficulty arose and the rules and regulations of the Fund
were very carefully observed. Complaints by the families of
soldiers themselves were very few, and all complaints were readily
adjusted. The expense of both collections and disbursements was
kept at a low figure, there being only one or two paid officials in
the larger counties, and these but part time. In addition to that,
some small grants were made for stenographic and clerical
assistance.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The Red Cross has been the Angel of Mercy to the soldier
lying on his fevered couch in hospital, for it brought to him
succor and a message of hope and cheer. But coming in
contact with it at a time when he was least able to apprehend the
efforts which brought the help so sorely needed, he is apt to regard
the Red Cross as a field institution and fails to appreciate the labor
and sacrifice of the women at home who made its work of mercy
possible.</p>

Society has been the raising of money, manufacturing and distribution
of goods, visiting and supplying the needs of hospital ships,
trains, military and convalescent hospitals, and arranging concerts,
drives and entertainments at private homes for returned men. Its
work did not terminate with the declaration of peace but still goes
on in almost as great a measure as in time of war, and will continue
to do so as long as one returned soldier remains in our
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many Nova Scotians, as well as returned men, do not appreciate
the magnitude of the task accomplished by the Nova Scotia Branch
of the Canadian Red Cross, and it is only possible here to give a
brief outline of its activities. The women of every city, town and
village in the Province gave the best of their thought, substance
and action in order that the citizen soldier of Nova Scotia, whether
in the fighting line or in hospital convalescing from wounds might
have every possible comfort. At the end of 1915 the Province had
thirty-one chartered and two hundred and sixty-eight auxiliary
branches of the Red Cross. Every village and hamlet had its
workers who contributed a steady stream of supplies and an enormous
amount of labor devolved upon the Provincial Branch at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Halifax, which acted as a Clearing House for all branches throughout
the Province.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers of the Provincial Branch during the War, with
slight changes of office but not of personnel, were as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Two thousand and ninety-nine cases of goods were sent Overseas,
and a greatly enlarged demand for goods was made on this
side of the water owing to the increasing number of returned men
and the opening of the new convalescent hospitals as well as the
arrival and departure of hospital ships and trains. The following

<p>MRS. F. B. M‘CURDY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Visitors were always on hand on the
arrival of hospital ships and the departure
of hospital trains to welcome
the returning men and to see that they
had every comfort necessary for the
remainder of their journey. A room
was given to the Red Cross Society for
the storing of supplies at Pier 2. This
was found most useful, as boats and
trains were despatched as soon as possible—only
a few hours’ notice being
given for the filling of requisitions, which work, however, was
speedily and ably done by Mrs. Sexton and her committee, Mrs.
F. B. McCurdy and Mrs. W. T. Allen, the latter of whom carried
on the work to the termination. Many returned men were detained
for days at Pier 2 until they went before their medical
board. For these, concerts and entertainments were provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>every evening by the Y.M.C.A., the Red Cross Society and the
Churches. A special Y.M.C.A. Musical Club was formed in this
connection which gave entertainments at a few hours’ notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two exhibitions of Red Cross work were held during the year,
one at the Nova Scotia Provincial Fair, and another at the Exhibit
of War Trophies, held in the Armories.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Committee on Sphagnum Surgical Dressings, under the able
supervision of the Secretary, Miss Margaret Brown, was appointed.
Dalhousie University very kindly gave the use of a fine laboratory,
where boxes of sphagnum, collected from various points along the
sea coast of the Province were prepared for use.</p>

<p>MISS JEAN FORREST.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Jean Forrest was appointed Superintendent of Supplies at
the Technical College and distributed parcels of yarn and cut-out
work at wholesale prices, to some one hundred and thirty branches
who found it difficult to obtain supplies locally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of maintaining a prisoner of war at this time was
$15 per month. The Nova Scotia Red Cross assumed the burden
of two-thirds, or $10 per month for 270 men, the Canadian Red
Cross paying the additional $5. The monthly sum required from
Nova Scotia for the support of prisoners was therefore $2,700.</p>

<p class='c007'>Receipts for the year ended October 31, 1918, amounted to
$408,482.66, of which $334,176.40 was raised by a Provincial Red
Cross drive for funds during the second week in July.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>The Canadian Red Cross Society at their Annual Meeting, held
in Toronto in 1917, decided to ask the different Provinces to raise
certain sums of money during the year. Two hundred thousand
dollars was named for Nova Scotia, but the Finance Committee
knowing full well that the people of the Province would gladly contribute
to the Red Cross War Fund raised the objective to
$250,000, and then started to work under the able direction of
Mr. J. L. Hetherington and Mr. H. E. Mahon. Committees of
citizens were formed in all the counties, and a complete organization
arranged, with the result that every county “went over the top,”
and the total amount contributed was $343,701.77. From this was
deducted $9,525.37 for expenses in connection with the campaign,
leaving the net amount of $334,176.40 to the Red Cross Society.
Never did men and women from one end of the Province to the
other work more enthusiastically, and never did our people contribute
more liberally than to this appeal from “the Greatest Mother
in the World.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the year 1918 the public maintained their interest in the
Prisoners of War Department of the Red Cross. The amount
collected was $20,943.01, of which $19,013.00 was forwarded to
headquarters in London, England, for the support of prisoners. The
food rations of each prisoner of war were despatched regularly
three times every fortnight, which, considering there were 270
men on the list, was no light undertaking. In addition to the food
supply the prisoners received two complete outfits of clothing, including
everything from shoes and socks to overcoats.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the signing of the Armistice the work of repatriating
prisoners went steadily on, and each steamer brought men who had
spent many weary months in the prison camps, and they all testified
to the value of the work done by this Society and declared that it
was solely due to this that they were enabled to return to their
homes. This department of Red Cross work has been most ably
conducted by Mrs. Charles Archibald, nobly assisted by Miss
Ritchie and Mrs. Longley.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beginning of this year was marked by the terrible Halifax
explosion, by which 1,635 persons lost their lives and 10,000 people
were rendered homeless. Much generous help was received by the
stricken city. Everyone knows the splendid aid sent by the American
Red Cross, and the people and Government of the United
States in despatching to Halifax train loads and boat loads of supplies,
together with surgeons and nurses. Their neighborly kindness
will never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the help rendered by our own Canadian Red Cross is perhaps
not so widely known. The Chairman of the Executive in
Toronto wired to the shipping agent in St. John to render every
assistance possible in money and goods. The agent, Mr. Milburne,
immediately requisitioned a special train, and brought with him all
the Red Cross goods he had ready for shipment Overseas, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>two car loads in all. This train was the first assistance from outside
the Province to reach Halifax. Hearing that some of the
injured had been conveyed to Truro, Mr. Milburne put off cases of
hospital necessaries for their use at that station. A medical supply
committee of the Canadian Red Cross Society was immediately
formed with the sanction of the Halifax Relief Committee, Mr.
Milburne being appointed Chairman, and Mrs. Sexton, Vice-Chairman,
with a Staff of forty-four voluntary workers. Twice daily all
the emergency hospitals were visited and their wants noted and
supplied the same day. The number of these hospitals, dressing
stations, etc., amounted to sixty-two.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time, gifts of clothing, food and money poured in
from Red Cross Branches all over Canada. Ottawa Branch shipped
in one day eight carloads of clothing. The Nova Scotia Branch,
under its President, Mrs. Dennis, co-operated heartily, practically
every Branch and Auxiliary in the Province sending substantial and
generous aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special mention must be made of the work of the President of
the Windsor Red Cross, Mrs. P. M. Fielding, who organized a
special train which arrived the evening of December 6th, bringing
doctors and nurses from Kentville, Windsor, Truro and neighboring
towns. The Windsor Red Cross alone spent $422.74 on
Red Cross supplies and provisions for this trip, Hantsport and
other Branches also providing hampers of food, so that the doctors
and nurses had their meals en route and arrived in Halifax ready
to go to work without an instant’s delay, thereby saving many lives.
Mrs. Fielding remained in the city, established and equipped three
dormitories, which accommodated in all seventy-five nurses. What
this meant to the stricken city will never be computed, and the Red
Cross feels that all who helped can never be sufficiently thanked.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until the end of March that the Red Cross was able
to resume its work for returned invalided soldiers. By that time
the hospital on Pier 2, wrecked by the explosion, had been repaired.
The hospital ships once more made their trips, and the Red Cross
storeroom on the pier was re-stocked. Large requisitions were filled
each month; sometimes only a few hours’ notice was given to get the
supplies on board—sometimes only a few minutes’ notice in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>case of a hospital train. On one trip the ship docked in the
morning, landed her men and went out again with her new supplies
in the afternoon. At another time 1,400 shipwrecked men
from <em>S.S. City of Vienna</em> were visited and supplied with filled kit
bags, containing toilet necessaries, pipes and tobacco. Directly
after, the Committee were called upon to minister to 300 influenza
contact cases. This necessitated the workers going into quarantine
for two days, very busy days, too, the telegrams alone requiring
upwards of 300 telephone calls. The Y.M.C.A. and the Knights of
Columbus Musical Club were always at hand to cheer up men who
were detained by the Medical Board, arranging for their benefit
concerts, entertainments, motor drives and teas at private houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight cases of goods
were sent Overseas, and the distribution of supplies on this side
grew very greatly during the year owing to the increasing number
of returned men and the opening of new convalescent homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The financial statement for the year ended October 31, 1918,
shows receipts of $36,848.65. Expenditures amounted to $41,804.01,
including the following items:</p>

<p class='c007'>No salaries whatever were paid to officers of the Red Cross
Society. The only persons connected with the work who received
anything for their services were the shipper at Red Cross warehouse
at Pier 2, who was responsible for the receiving and sending forward
of our boxes, and the Office Secretary who took charge of the
correspondence, kept the books, etc. She was assisted by a large
corps of voluntary workers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>With the signing of the Armistice great changes naturally took
place in the daily work of the Nova Scotia Red Cross. Workers
decreased in number, and those who remained faithful had to work
extremely hard, as, although it was considered that the stores
already sent would be sufficient for all Overseas demands, the
reserve stock of stores for use in the hospitals in our own Province
had to be kept up.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of the Armistice the surgical sphagnum dressings
were still very greatly needed. Special efforts were put into this
work, which continued till free transportation ceased on March 31st.
Forty-five boxes of the dressings were sent Overseas. An eminent
Surgeon-Colonel in one of the Overseas hospitals gave it as his
opinion that sphagnum dressings had saved the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Work for refugees of the devastated area of France was then
taken up, sanctioned by the Head Office in Toronto, who provided
samples and gave permission to use Red Cross materials for this
good work. The patterns were duplicated in our office and distributed
to Branches throughout the Province. The work was
carried on for two months and 217 boxes of garments were sent
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Change of quarters for the Red Cross became imperative. The
Technical College, which had sheltered Red Cross workers during
the four years of the War, and had so generously allowed them the
use of valuable equipment of every kind, was now overcrowded
with its own work for returned soldiers. It was therefore decided
to take over the lease of No. 314 Barrington Street from the American
Red Cross, which had occupied it for the last year.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was thought best to continue the Canteen which the American
Red Cross had established until such time as the Y.M.C.A. should
take up this work. This Canteen, under the management of Mrs.
Sexton, had a wonderful success, becoming a happy and home-like
centre for returned men and greatly appreciated—especially the hot
Sunday dinners served by devoted workers. Much regret was
expressed when, at the end of three months, it was closed and the
work handed over to the newly-opened Red Triangle Hut next door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal work throughout the year was supplying the needs
of the hospitals. Mrs. Munnis, who worked so faithfully as the
Convener of the Hospital Committee resigned and was replaced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Mrs. Sexton. An enlarged committee was formed and a large staff
of visitors began their duties, each having a special ward assigned
to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twelve sun parlors at Camp Hill Hospital were furnished for
the use of convalescents and made as comfortable and home-like as
possible. The estimated cost was $500 each, subscribed for by the
following Red Cross Branches: Amherst, Windsor, Wolfville,
Westville, Trenton, Glace Bay, Halifax, Truro, Hazel Hill, Joggins
Mines, New Glasgow and North Sydney. A brass plate, bearing
the name of the donor, was affixed to the wall of each parlor.
The cost exceeded the estimate by $240 each, which excess was
paid from the central treasury.</p>

<p class='c007'>From November 11, 1918, until September 30, 1919, 220,000
men passed through the Port of Halifax, and 92 ships were met
and as far as possible these men had the use of the Red Cross
rooms at the pier. The Port Committee was on hand day and
night to help make their landing on Canadian soil (many of them
after years of service) a great home-coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first days of disembarkation all men for Canada were
held at Halifax for documentation. Later the military authorities
changed their plan and it became their ambition to disembark and
entrain these men in the shortest possible time so that only Maritime
men waiting for local trains or men held for hospital treatment
came under the care of the Committee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on the Repatriation Department of the Canadian Government
requested the Red Cross to undertake the care of the returning
soldiers’ families. About 5,000 soldiers’ dependants passed through
Halifax and a fully trained nurse was placed on each train containing
soldiers’ wives and children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hospital equipment was provided at Pier No. 2 for any women
and children who were unfit to travel after landing from boat, or
whose husbands were military patients and could not proceed.
Often their luggage was not obtainable, and the Red Cross was
called upon to supply such necessaries as infants’ outfits, women’s
pyjamas and bath robes, towels, soap, combs, hot water bottles,
medicines, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March when the Canadian Government decided to send the
hospital ships to Portland, Maine, instead of Halifax, Col. Noel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Marshall requested that a Committee of our Port Workers should
inaugurate the work at the new port. Mrs. W. T. Allen, Mrs. J. L.
Hetherington and Mrs. F. B. McCurdy accordingly proceeded to
Portland and very satisfactory arrangements were made whereby
the Canadian Red Cross continued to fit ships with hospital stores,
while the American Red Cross very courteously and generously
provided canteen facilities and served refreshments to all the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps no department of the Red Cross has developed more
enthusiasm or been more splendidly supported than the work of
Prisoners’ Relief. From a very small beginning it grew to be work
of great importance, and one in which the people of Nova Scotia
have abundantly shown their practical interest. It did not draw
upon the general Red Cross Funds but appealed for a special
offering from the public or from friends of men who were prisoners
of war and found a most gratifying response, no less than $41,448
having been contributed for this special purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Approximately 270 Canadian prisoners of war in forty-one
different internment camps in Germany were maintained wholly or
in part through the kindness of the people of Nova Scotia, at a
cost per head of $10 per month. Almost all these men were
“adopted” by friends or societies; that is, such persons or societies
agreed to pay a certain sum per month towards their maintenance,
two dollars and fifty cents having been fixed as the minimum
amount. The name and address of the adopted was given to the
man, and his name, number and prison address to the adopter, and
letters and cards were exchanged between them, often arousing a
deep personal interest on the one hand and a sense of gratitude and
appreciation on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Archibald and Miss Ritchie were brought in close contact
with the homes and families of prisoners of war. The amount of
correspondence was very considerable, and the system used entailed
a lot of bookkeeping. The name and number of each man, date
of capture, prison camp and any details that could be gathered
were registered on a card index. The name of the “adopter”
was also registered both here and with the Prisoners of War
Department in London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Close touch was kept with the Department of “Missing Men,”
conducted in London and in a few instances it was possible to
convey reassuring news to sorrow-stricken friends of the “missing
men,” although, too often, it became necessary to deprive them of
the hope they so touchingly clung to. Yet even the bad news was
softened somewhat by details of the death or capture of a man,
obtained under the system inaugurated by Lady Drummond of
“Searchers” in hospitals who sought out wounded men of the
same Platoon or Battalion of the person enquired for. These
men, if able to write, would themselves send a few words telling
when and where they had seen their less fortunate comrades. Even
these meagre details were of some comfort to the mourning ones.
Some of the heart-broken letters received were very hard to reply
to, but when news was good and food parcels arrived safely showers
of “acknowledgment cards” flowed in; and when, as often happened,
the mail brought a personal letter from some grateful mother
or a few words from some of the poor boys behind barbed wire
“somewhere in Germany,” or when a rapturous letter came from
some poor fellow transferred from his prison as “totally unfit” and
sent to the free air of Switzerland, the ladies conducting this
Department felt more than happy in being permitted to participate
in such a work of mercy. Mrs. Archibald, Miss Ritchie, and their
co-workers possessed in no small degree the confidence of the
prisoners’ friends throughout the Province and deeply appreciated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>their attitude toward them and their loyalty and patience with the
many unavoidable delays and mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last two years of the War, as the work became
heavier, this Department had associated with it Mrs. W. McK.
McLeod, who acted as Secretary for Cape Breton, and Miss Almon.
Special mention must also be made of the work of Miss Clara
Dennis in meeting and welcoming home repatriated men who had
been prisoners of war. During 1918–19 one thousand and eight of
these men were met and greeted by Miss Dennis. To each man
was handed a card of welcome from the Red Cross and a box of
confectionery. He was asked to record his name, regimental number,
German prison camp, and his home address in a book specially
prepared for the purpose. That the men appreciated this informal
but hearty welcome home is abundantly proved by the fact that
Miss Dennis has since received from them hundreds of letters of
thanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to give in detail the names of the many thousands
of devoted and faithful voluntary workers throughout the
Province of Nova Scotia who sought no reward for their labors
but the joy of knowing that the Society achieved its aim—the
alleviation of the sufferings of our fighting men.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE WILLING WAR WORKERS, GLACE BAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>An organization that blazed a new and unique track in the
War, and accomplished great results, especially in the colliery
districts of Cape Breton, was the Willing War Workers of
Glace Bay.</p>

<p>MRS. G. S. HARRINGTON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A number of the mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts of the
boys “over there,” finding that other Societies lacked the personal
touch, banded themselves together to send
parcels every week to their own home
boys in France, and kept up the good
work enthusiastically until Armistice Day,
when they disbanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Gordon S. Harrington, wife of
Colonel Harrington, Deputy Overseas
Minister, was the first President, and Mrs.
Stuart McCawley, of Glace Bay, the
Secretary-Treasurer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Harrington went to England in
November, 1916, and became actively interested
in war work for Canadian soldiers
in that country, particularly at the Beaver Hut, Strand,
London, and St. Dunstan’s Hostel for blinded soldiers.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE GREEN FEATHER SOCIETY LADIES’ AUXILIARY OF THE 185TH BATTALION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Society was organized on March 9, 1916. The aim of
the Society was, first, to aid recruiting; second, to look after
the comfort of the men while quartered at Broughton, and
as far as possible after they had gone Overseas; third, to assist in
every possible way the wives and families of the men enlisting.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>From the time of the Society’s organization until the 185th
Battalion was disbanded, the Society raised the sum of $2,075.36,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>which was devoted entirely to the use and comfort of the Battalion.
In addition to this, Mr. Walshaw, of the D.T.S. Co., collected the
sum of $70.00, and the North Sydney Branch of the Green Feather
Society also donated the sum of $43.00. These amounts were sent
to England for the purpose of procuring Christmas dinners for the
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visiting committee of the Society did very good work in
looking after the wives and children of the men who had gone
Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the War there was the sum of $12.00 in funds,
which was presented to the G.W.V.A. after their organization.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CATHOLIC LADIES’ PATRIOTIC SOCIETY, SYDNEY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This Society was organized the second year of the War by
the ladies of the Sacred Heart Parish, Sydney, and was
intended to supply the religious needs of the Cape Breton
soldiers and Chaplains, and to send comforts direct to the soldiers
in the trenches. However, as the War went on, the Society enlarged
its scope and embraced all kinds of patriotic work. The
work of the Society was carried on by packing tin boxes with
fruit cake, candy, cigarettes, socks, khaki shirts, and other things
too numerous to mention. These were addressed to each soldier
and acknowledged in due time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of the Society was in no small measure due to the
activity of the President, Mrs. V. F. Cunningham, who held that
office during the four years of the Society’s existence.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER LIII.<br /> <em>THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Until the spring of 1918, the war work of the Knights of
Columbus in Nova Scotia consisted in aiding the work
carried on at St. Mary’s Army and Navy Club at Halifax,
and in sending money Overseas to aid the Catholic Army Huts
in England and at the Front. The work done by these Huts became
more and more extensive as the War went on, and the amount of
money that each council could send from its own funds became
wholly inadequate to enable these Huts to give efficient service.</p>

<p class='c007'>In May, 1918, His Lordship the Right Reverend James Morrison,
Bishop of Antigonish, addressed a letter to the Knights of
Columbus of the Maritime Provinces, setting out the needs of the
Catholic Army Huts and the slender financial resources at their
disposal. “Accordingly,” he says, “I feel it a pressing duty to
ask the Knights of Columbus to organize a general public campaign
for funds to provide our Catholic soldiers Overseas, or wherever
they may be assembled, with Catholic Huts, Club Rooms and
accessories thereto, in which the Army Chaplains may be enabled
more efficiently and more conveniently to minister to their religious
welfare, and where the soldiers themselves, irrespective of denominational
affiliations, may have at their disposal such accommodations
in social life as may be a proper safeguard for their moral
welfare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the receipt of this letter the Knights began the work of
organizing a campaign which extended throughout the whole of
Canada. More than one million dollars were raised in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Dominion, to which sum the various counties of Nova Scotia
contributed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Drive” by which this money was raised took place during
the week of August 19–24, 1918. The whole of the amount raised
was intended for work in England and France but, with the signing
of the Armistice, the returned soldier problem demanded the
attention of the Knights, and Huts were opened in Halifax and the
other dispersal areas in Canada. The work in Canada and Overseas
was under the supervision of Lieut.-Col. Clarence F. Smith,
of Montreal, Comptroller. Large sums of the money were sent
Overseas and the balance was devoted to the work of serving the
returned men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following are the names on the Executive Committee of the
Knights of Columbus War Activities:—Messrs. John A. Neville,
John F. O’Connell, Jas. D. O’Connor, Walter M. Godsoe, Thos. W.
Murphy, Frank A. Gillis, Dan. T. Lynagh, Wm. A. Hallisey, Jno.
P. Quinn, Hon. Judge Chisholm, and Mr. William R. Wakely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Knights of Columbus Catholic Army Hut, at No. 372
Barrington Street, was opened December 1, 1918, and Halifax
may be regarded as the birth-place of the work of the Knights of
Columbus Catholic Army Huts in Canada. All men of the Allied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Armies and Navies were welcome, irrespective of race, creed or
color. The Knights of Columbus’ slogan, “Everybody Welcome,
Everything Free,” was carried out to the letter, with the exception
that a charge of 25c. was made for beds, although of the total number
of beds used about half were donated, inasmuch as many of the
guests were in need of funds. Men arriving in transports were
also given a bed free of charge. Mr. J. D. O’Connor was Chairman
of the Hut Committee, and associated with him were Mr. John
F. O’Connell, Mr. D. T. Lynagh, the late W. A. Monoghan, Mr.
W. J. Williams, Mr. E. J. Scanlon, Mr. W. A. Hallisey, Mr.
W. T. Murphy, Mr. W. E. Donovan, Mr. J. K. Kelleher, and Mr.
W. R. Wakely. There was an average daily attendance at the Hut
during December, 1918, January, February and March, 1919, of
1,300 to 1,500, and a total attendance of 177,060 from December 1,
1918, until the Hut closed on September 13, 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. W. E. Donovan, Chairman of the Entertainment Committee,
arranged for weekly entertainments. The men in uniform were
always most appreciative of the class of entertainment given at the
Hut under the direction of the Chairman. He had the happy
faculty of selecting the very best artists, and had the Columbus
Musical Club to draw from as well as other local clubs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Refreshments were always served. Mr. W. E. Donovan never
failed to have a number of young ladies in attendance, and they
saw that every guest was generously supplied. The Hut was open
daily from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., and on Sundays from 1 p.m. to
11 p.m., and the men had free use of the reading, writing and
billiard rooms. Canadian and American newspapers and magazines
were supplied; writing paper and envelopes and all billiard
and pool games were free. 12,983 games of billiards and pool
were played from December, 1918, to September 13, 1919. May
10, 1919, a dormitory of fifty beds was opened, and from that date
to September 13, 1919, 2,725 beds were used. Of that number
1,279 were supplied free of charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Space in the building would not permit of the Knights of
Columbus War Activities having a cafeteria, but there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>canteen from which the following supplies were given away free,
from December 1, 1918, to September 13, 1919:—</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until after the Armistice was signed that a Pier
Committee was organized under the able leadership of Mr. John
P. Quinn as Chairman. His associates were Messrs. John Neville,
Henry T. Kline, Harry C. Murphy, John D. Campbell, E. J.
Murphy, John Fry, J. J. Penny, P. J. Hanifen, R. J. Flinn, Geo.
A. Gauvin, and W. E. Donovan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Returned Soldiers’ Reception Committee, made up of
twenty-five men selected from the various clubs and organizations
of Halifax City, with an Auxiliary Committee of five ladies, was
organized in November, 1916. From that date the Committee
received troop and hospital ships, and raised by voluntary subscription
$9,178.96. It also received $3,000.00 from the Halifax
Victory Loan canvassers. Mr. John P. Quinn waited upon Mr.
W. S. Davidson, Chairman of the Returned Soldiers’ Reception
Committee, and informed Mr. Davidson that the Knights of Columbus
were prepared to spend an amount of their funds toward
the reception of the troops returning from Overseas, either in
conjunction with the Returned Soldiers’ Reception Committee, or
alone. This brought in the Red Cross and the Y.M.C.A., and an
agreement was made by each of the three organizations to contribute
to the funds of the Returned Soldiers’ Reception Committee
to the extent of one-third each of the amount required by the
Returned Soldiers’ Committee. From January 1, 1919, until the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>troopship arrived, $9,000.00 was contributed from each of the
three organizations—a total of $27,000.00. These funds were used
for the purpose of purchasing cigarettes, fruit, chocolate bars,
matches, flowers, newspapers, welcome cards, and for postage and
telegrams.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the time the work began, one hundred and thirty-eight
troopships disembarked about 305,655 men. In the distribution
of supplies at the pier, the work was divided among seven teams
of twelve each, each team having a captain and an equal number
of representatives from the Knights of Columbus, the Red Cross,
Y.M.C.A., and the Returned Soldiers’ Reception Committee. Mr.
Felix P. Quinn, of the Knights of Columbus, was a captain of
one of the teams.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was decided by the Hospitals Committee on Thursday,
December 19, 1918, that candy and smokes should be sent to
Kentville for the 200 patients. Four hundred boxes were prepared
containing three packages of cigarettes and a half-pound
of candy for each patient. This work was done by a voluntary
committee of three little girls and one little boy (the Misses
O’Connor and Master O’Connor, daughters and son of Mr. J. D.
O’Connor), and by little Miss Elliott. Provision was made for
Rock Head and Cogswell Hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>December 18, 1918, 328 stockings were made and filled by a
committee of ladies at the Knights of Columbus Club Rooms,
Hollis Street. The stockings were all of different shades, and each
contained fourteen articles, consisting of the following: One box
of notepaper, one lead pencil, one cube of tooth paste, one tooth
brush, three packages cigarettes, two boxes of matches, one small
comb, one pocket handkerchief, one ash-tray, two chocolate bars,
collar buttons, one pipe, one package tobacco and one tobacco
pouch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two hundred and three of these were sent to Camp Hill and
one hundred and twenty-five to Pine Hill. As there were a number
of very sick patients at Cogswell Street Station Hospital, it was
requested that fruit be sent, and three cases of oranges, four cases
of grape fruit and one keg of grapes were supplied. To the Nova
Scotia Hospital, Dartmouth, one hundred and forty parcels were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>sent containing three packages of cigarettes and a half-pound of
candy. Stockings were sent to four soldiers in the County Jail,
and nine stockings to soldiers in the Victoria General Hospital.
To the N.S. Naval Air Station were sent two cases of oranges,
two hundred packages cigarettes, two hundred cigars and two
hundred chocolate bars.</p>

<p class='c013'>Christmas boxes were sent from the Head Office in Montreal,

Safety Razor, one package razor blades, one shaving stick, one
shaving brush, one package cigarettes, one box matches, one
chocolate bar, one tooth brush, one tube tooth paste, one handkerchief,
and short stories. In addition twenty-six quarts of ice cream
were distributed, also five hundred apples, fifty pounds of assorted
kisses and fifty pounds of frosted cake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many picnics were given patients who were convalescing during

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>For years previous to the Declaration of War, the Y.M.C.A.
carried on its work in the summer Militia Camps; consequently
the War did not find the Association without some
idea of the requirements of troops, and from the early days of the
first big concentration at Valcartier, the “Y” tried hard to measure
up to each new phase of war activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1914 about 5,000 men were served in the camps of the Maritime
Provinces. During the succeeding winter Y.M.C.A. work was
established in the various barracks, and in 1915 the work on the
piers at the points of embarkation was started. All this work was
carried on continually from this time with increasing efficiency,
not only in camps, barracks, and hospitals, but also on board transports
and on troop trains carrying returning men. It consisted of
the erection of large recreation buildings, giving assistance with the
equipping of recreation rooms in barracks; the provision of free
writing and reading materials, games, athletic goods, music, pianos,
gramophones and records, moving picture machines and films; the
organizing of concerts on land and on board ships; social evenings
in homes, churches, barracks, hospitals and otherwise; athletics, religious
services; supplying free hot drinks and doughnuts or biscuits
at the disembarkation points and demobilization centres.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first large financial appeal was made to the people of the
Maritime Provinces in the spring of 1916, when approximately
$34,500 were raised for home and Overseas’ military work. During
that year Association service was rendered to troops in eighteen
different places in these Provinces. Each succeeding year saw
most successful campaigns for larger sums of money, until 1918,
when requirements began to decrease. Altogether about $679,600
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>were raised in the Maritime area and spent on military work at
home and Overseas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Large recreation buildings, which were much needed, were
erected at Aldershot and Sussex Camps, each capable of accommodating
close to 1,000 men. These were used to capacity, and were
practically the only adequate recreation centres. A large hut was
erected in the Naval Dockyard, Halifax, for the men of the navy
and the merchant marine. It was destroyed by the explosion, but
was replaced by a larger structure, and was the great social centre
for the men of the navy and the merchant marine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large Red Triangle Hut, on Barrington Street, Halifax,
was erected as a demobilization service to offset the inadequate
housing facilities in Halifax, to provide meals and beds for returning
men who had to remain in the city while waiting for trains or
demobilization, to assist returned men to become re-established in
civil life by providing them with wholesome meals and beds at
prices within their means, to help men taking Government re-training
courses and drawing barely enough money to live on, and to provide
them with a clean, attractive recreation centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other recreation huts were built and equipped at St. John, New
Brunswick, and Cogswell Hospital, Halifax. A large building was
leased and equipped as a Red Triangle Club at St. John, N.B.
Clubs on a smaller scale were operated in Sydney, Windsor, Kentville,
Nova Scotia, and Fredericton and Sussex, New Brunswick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Work was carried on among the German prisoners of war at
Amherst in return for which the German Government permitted
the Y.M.C.A. to carry on work in certain camps in Germany where
Canadians were confined. Only the work in the Internment Camps
in Canada made this concession possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Co-operating with the Sailors’ Comforts’ Committee, Halifax, the
Y.M.C.A. workers visited many ships of the merchant service and
supplied the men with reading and writing materials, games,
mufflers, sweaters, socks, gloves, mitts, underwear, etc. Concerts
were frequently arranged for the crews on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Uniform reports of activities and the attendance were not kept
in the early days of the War, and it is impossible to arrive at anything
like accurate estimates of the extent of some of the services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>rendered. The report of a few activities for the <em>two years of
maximum efficiency</em> may serve to indicate, however, the great extent
to which the men patronized the Y.M.C.A. military services.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the disembarkation piers, in co-operation with various
women’s organizations, the Creche in Halifax, and the combined
organizations in St. John, free hot or cold drinks and mixed biscuits
were provided. At the Demobilization Centre, Halifax, co-operating
with the G.W.V.A. Ladies’ Auxiliary, drinks and doughnuts or
mixed biscuits were supplied free, and a six months’ membership
ticket in any Y.M.C.A. was given to each man.</p>

<p class='c007'>A “Y” representative accompanied each troop train to its destination
and carried a standard stock of equipment, gramophones,
portable organs, music, song sheets, games, fruits, chocolate, and
cigarettes. He rendered personal services in every way possible,
such as wiring ahead, mailing letters, and carrying on a programme
of concerts and games. These representatives were principally business
men, and all gave their services voluntarily. In all 449 representatives
accompanied troop trains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further assistance was given returned men to re-establish themselves
by Red Triangle Clubs at Halifax and St. John, where bed
and board could be had at reduced rates. During the first year of
the Halifax Club. 147,713 meals were served, and 38,855 beds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>occupied for one night or more. This work is still going on. The
rate for bed and board was $1 per day. The food was far above
the average meal at similar prices. A programme of entertainments,
athletics, moving pictures, religious services, and educational
lectures and discussions was carried on. The Association’s hospital
service will be continued as long as necessary, and funds are available.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER LV.<br /> <em>THE HALIFAX CITIZENS’ RECEPTION COMMITTEE.</em></h2>
</div>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_381.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>W. S. DAVIDSON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The splendid service performed by the Halifax Citizens’ Returned
Soldiers’ Reception Committee had its inception in the
fall of 1916, when Mr. P. F. Martin, at that time Mayor of
the city, called a number of representative citizens together at the
city hall for the purpose of forming a committee to extend a
welcome to the men returning home. The matter did not take
definite form, however, until a little
later on, when a score of energetic
citizens selected by the various National
Societies, the Board of Trade and other
organizations of the city, met at the
Board of Trade Rooms in November,
1916, at the call of Mr. W. S.
Davidson, Vice-President of the Board.
At this meeting the Committee was
organized, as also an Auxiliary Committee
of the following ladies:—Mrs. G.
McGregor Mitchell, Mrs. Geoffery
Morrow, Mrs. T. Sherman Rogers,
Mrs. Norwood Duffus, and Mrs. (Dr.) Ryan. Mr. W. S. Davidson
was elected Chairman, Mr. Arthur B. Mitchell, Secretary, Mr. A. M.
Smith, Assistant-Secretary, and Mr. W. A. Major, Treasurer.
The excellence of the choice of this Executive was amply proven
by the fact that the personnel remained unchanged from the night
the Committee was formed until the last transport docked, and the
work was finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following gentlemen composed the original Committee:
Messrs. W. S. Davidson, W. A. Major, H. H. Marshall, C. H.
Mitchell, J. McL. Fraser, Felix P. Quinn, C. E. Creighton, W. A.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Hart, A. M. Smith, Paul Creighton, W. E. Hebb, C. H. Climo, W. L.
Kane, J. P. Quinn, P. T. Strong, and R. B. Colwell, representing
the North British Society, St. George’s Society, the Charitable
Irish Society, the Canadian Club, and the Citizens of Halifax in
general.</p>

<p class='c007'>These gentlemen, who became known as “the originals,” carried
on through fair weather and foul, night or day as occasion required
from start to finish. The only exception was Mr. H. H. Marshall,
who, to the great regret of his friends and fellow-workers, was
ordered by his physician to seek a change of climate, his health having
broken down, but nevertheless, he was with the work in spirit,
always keeping in touch, sending greetings and material aid from
time to time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to those above-mentioned, the following gentlemen
joined the movement later, entering into the spirit of the work
with energy and enthusiasm: Messrs. E. J. Murphy, G. J. Allen,
Cyril Gorham, A. W. Robb, W. R. Morton, H. C. Murphy, Hugh
Fraser, Chas. Waterfield, R. A. Wood, W. S. Munnis, John D.
Campbell, P. J. Hannifen, Geo. M. Wood, F. M. Guildford, R. K.
Elliott, George Ritchie, G. W. Perry, J. A. Neville, H. T. Kline,
J. A. Reid, V. B. Faulkner, J. L. Wilson, E. M. McLeod, Geo. T.
McNutt, John Fry, J. J. Penny, J. M. Davison, George Robinson,
W. R. Scriven, Wm. Wilson, Capt. W. F. Mitchell, W. E. Donavon,
G. A. Smith, J. F. Roue, Walter Black, R. J. Flinn, G. A. Gauvin,
George Winters, Howard Lawrence, W. Cyril Smith, Cyril Stairs,
Sedley E. Thompson, J. L. Hetherington, H. E. Mahon, C. H.
Wright, the late Professor Eben McKay, F. A. Marr, Allen Patrick,
and H. R. Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of ladies, Mrs. W. T. Allen, Mrs. M. R. Morrow and
others, joined the original Auxiliary Committee of five above-mentioned,
doing splendid work in connection with the cot cases, etc.,
but unfortunately a complete list is not available. Two young
ladies deserving of special mention who became associated with the
General Committee are Miss Edna Davison and Miss Helen Creighton.
Their work was admirable, being here, there, and everywhere
when required, untiring in their efforts, having the capacity to perform,
as well as zeal to undertake. It is safe to say that the soldier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>boys who landed at Halifax will never forget the ladies connected
with this Committee; for their bright kindly faces, apart from their
work, gave them a welcome home which is hard to express in words;
and it was not only on fine days when the sun was shining that
they were to be seen on the pier when transports were expected,
but in all kinds of weather, night as well as day, and only those
who worked there know how cold it sometimes was at Pier 2 on
a winter night. However, the welcome given the boys was warm
enough to take away the chill of the weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the period in which this Committee carried on its work,
138 transports disembarked some 200,000 Overseas men at Pier 2,
and of this number very few indeed missed the kindly attentions of
the Committee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The amount expended was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A word or two in connection with these figures which are from
the Treasurer’s report. The item for postage, etc., would have
been much larger but through the representations of the Committee,
after the work had been carried on for a considerable time, the
Government was induced to allow letters from returned men, on
arrival, to be posted free, thus conserving the funds for other
purposes. The item $15 for music does not mean that this was
the extent of the music by any means; for the Commanding
Officers of local military units very cheerfully permitted their
bands to play on the pier on arrival of transports.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Of the above total amount, the sum of $9,178.96 was received
in voluntary subscriptions, and $3,000 from Halifax Victory Loan
canvassers, which came in spontaneously and entirely unsolicited.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the end of the War approached and the number of returning
men became greater, it became apparent that the funds would require
to be largely augmented, and in order to cope with the good
work, the Y.M.C.A., the Red Cross Society, and the Knights of
Columbus very generously contributed equal amounts of $9,000, less
a refund to each of these organizations of $266.06, being the balance
or surplus left over at the close of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long after the work began until a splendid system
was evolved which worked with almost clock-like precision. The
usual procedure was as follows: Immediately a transport was
docked a certain number of the Committee were told off to go on
board with the latest newspapers, collect telegrams and letters which
were, as mentioned above, sent off free of charge, thus doing away
with the inconvenience of hunting up stamps, etc. Whenever it happened
that a ship had to drop anchor in the stream while waiting
for a berth to dock at the pier—and as these were busy days in
shipping circles in Halifax, this very frequently happened—a tugboat
was promptly secured by the energetic Chairman, and a contingent
landed on board with newspapers, cigarettes, matches, fruit,
etc.; and, in most cases, if the ship was to remain at anchor over-night,
a concert party was always ready to join their efforts with
those of the Committee in extending a hearty welcome to the boys,
many excellent entertainments being given on board transports
waiting to dock. The very best musical talent in Halifax was
always ready and willing to respond at a moment’s notice to calls of
this nature. Mr. Davidson being one of the principal members of
the large shipping firm of Messrs. G. S. Campbell and Co., of
course always knew where to locate one of these tug-boats, as they
own and operate a number of them, and although in the forefront as
business men, and blessed with good memories, they must have forgotten
to render any bills or charge for this excellent service.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the men left the ship and were entrained, a sufficient
number of Committee-men having in the meantime been told off
and sub-divided, allowing an equal number to look after each car,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the cars being designated by letters “A,” “B,” “C,” and so on,
beginning with the car nearest the engine, and each party knowing
the particular car it had to look after, confusion or oversight was
practically nil. The first Committee-man went through the car
with baskets of apples and oranges, being followed by another with
cigarettes and matches, a third and fourth bringing up the rear
with chocolate bars, welcome cards, newspapers, and collecting any
letters or postal cards the boys had scribbled while waiting for
their train to back in. Oftentimes when large steamships like the
<em>Olympic</em>, <em>Mauretania</em>, or <em>Aquitania</em> arrived, fifteen or twenty trains
would be dispatched with an average time between of twenty or
twenty-five minutes; so that the necessity for system was evident,
or otherwise only a portion of the boys would be looked after; but
in the way in which the work was handled every man received
attention; and usually a few minutes were left over, before the
conductor called “All aboard,” in which to chat with them, give
them a hearty handshake and wish them “Bon voyage” and a safe
journey to their destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sketch of the work of the Halifax Citizens’ Returned
Soldiers’ Reception Committee is necessarily short. It does not
begin to express the scope or extent of the work carried on by
this Committee, but the boys who returned home no doubt still
remember the way they were received and treated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Letters of appreciation were received from all parts of Canada
and points in the United States. Such evidence of appreciation
amply rewarded the Committee for any efforts they had made to
ensure a hearty, and pleasant welcome home to those splendid men,
who made the name of Canada for ever respected and glorious.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER LVI.<br /> <em>ST. JOHN AMBULANCE BRIGADE OVERSEAS<br /> and<br /> THE CRECHE AT PIER 2, HALIFAX.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The first branch of the St. John Ambulance Brigade Overseas
established in Nova Scotia was organized in June, 1916, as
the Halifax Central Nursing Division No. 17, with Mrs. Bowman,
Superintendent of the Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, as
Lady Divisional Superintendent. This division, besides being the
first in the Maritime Provinces, was the largest in Canada. Most
of the officers were graduate nurses, and all of the members had
received their instruction in First Aid and Home Nursing through
classes lheld in Halifax by the sister organization, the St. John
Ambulance Association.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Mrs. Bowman’s removal from Halifax, Mrs. G. A.
MacIntosh was appointed Superintendent (April, 1917). Owing to
greatly increased membership, and for the purposes of more
efficient administration, the division was divided in July, 1918, into
two Units, A. No. 17 and B. No. 47, Mrs. MacIntosh being promoted
at the same time to be Lady District Superintendent in
charge of the Women’s Aid Department (Military District No. 6).
In January, 1920, a reorganization of the two divisions was made
effective by which all active officers and members were assigned to
Division A. 17, and the inactive members, or those in reserve for
emergencies, to B. 47. The active division continues as one of the
most efficient and effective in Canada under the able superintendence
of Miss E. M. Pemberton, of the Victoria General Hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war work in Nova Scotia of this organization falls under
four heads:</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>a</em>) Its work in Military Hospitals as auxiliary to the Army Medical
and Nursing Service.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>b</em>) Its work in Nova Scotia in connection with the Red Cross Society,
Y.M.C.A. Canteens, and other voluntary patriotic organizations.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>c</em>) Its work of ministration to women and children returning from
England.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>(<em>d</em>) Its emergency work on the day of the Halifax Disaster and in the
relief work and hospital service for the weeks and months following
the disaster.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>(<em>a</em>) HOSPITAL SERVICE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Hospital duties performed by the members of the Halifax
Divisions during the War include:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) Eleven members who went Overseas, serving with great
credit in hospitals in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) Local hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>We believe Pine Hill was the first Military Hospital in Canada
to recognize or use the services of the Brigade members. Three
pioneers served for two years and were followed by others.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter part of 1918 the Women’s Aid Department was
formed in Canada in co-operation with the military authorities, the
Lady District Superintendent furnishing to the A.D.M.S. of each
Military District the following personnel, the number given below
being that of those who served in M.D. No. 6:—</p>

<p class='c030'>1. <em>Volunteer Section</em>:—</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>a</em>) Nursing service of Brigade members, eight of whom served at Pine
Hill Military Hospital.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>b</em>) Function Trainers, also Brigade members trained at Hart House,
Toronto, two of whom served at Camp Hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Special Service Section</em>:—</p>

<p class='c030'>Masseuses, trained at Hart House, Toronto, members of St. John Ambulance
Brigade, and serving at Camp Hill, Moxham Ross, Prince
Edward Island Military Hospitals.</p>

<p class='c030'><em>Section 3</em>:—</p>

<p class='c030'>General Service Section consisting of a General Service Superintendent
Assistant Superintendent, bookkeepers, domestics and many there
not Brigade members, but for a short time recommended by the
Women’s Aid Department of the Brigade.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>c</em>) Before the Women’s Aid Department came into effect five members
had served at the Nova Scotia Sanatorium in the tent Colony for
tubercular soldiers.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>d</em>) During the Influenza epidemic of 1918 six members assisted the depleted
staffs in the Victoria General, the Dartmouth Emergency
for two months, two members at Infants Home for two months,
also for two months in the homes of the sick, at the Emergency
Hospital, Hazelwood Hospital, St. Mary’s Emergency Hospital,
and for three weeks at Brocton Field Hospital, Mass. During the
epidemic in the spring of 1919 a diet kitchen was organized and
conducted and proper nourishment prepared and delivered to all
asking for it, in the majority of cases no charge being made.
The Brigade responded to requests for diet from the Victorian
Order of Nurses, City Board of Health, Social Welfare Bureau, etc.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>e</em>) The hospital work performed after the explosion is mentioned
separately.</p>

<p class='c030'>(<em>f</em>) Miscellaneous duties performed in hospitals include mending each
week at the Station Hospital, emergency bedmaking at Camp Hill
and hospital train service.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>(<em>b</em>) MISCELLANEOUS WORK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At the Clearing Depot, Pier 2, a splendid work was accomplished.
Over 13,000 beds were made for soldiers disembarking
at this port. At very short notice members in sufficient numbers
quickly responded to a call from the C.O. to prepare the beds
required (at times as many as 800 beds were needed) in readiness
for the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important work carried on at Pier 2 was the serving of meals
three times daily for over a week to 150 men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boats were met by the Lady District Superintendent, who,
assisted by the members, welcomed and assisted when necessary any
V.A.D.’s returning to Canada from Overseas duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very interesting and important service rendered by the organization
was in connection with the vocational re-education of the
soldiers. For eight months two members read daily to blinded
soldiers, assisting them in this way with their study. Four other
members also performed like service for five and a half months.
Ten members took a special two months’ course in weaving and
basketry, nine of whom were able to instruct patients at Camp Hill
Hospital for from one to seven months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Truly patriotic work has been performed under the Y.M.C.A.
At their Red Triangle Hut a team of eight members have given one
day each week and every sixth Sunday for one and a half years to
serve meals to returned soldiers taking vocational courses in the
city. Members have also served refreshments on trains to soldiers
recently discharged and entraining for their homes. At the
Armories members have responded at all hours, sometimes working
all night to serve refreshments to soldiers just disembarked and
awaiting their discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Red Cross has been ably assisted by the making of numerous
garments, surgical supplies, sphagnum moss dressings, and the
raising of funds during campaigns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following “drives” have been given willing and able
support:—</p>

<p class='c019'>Navy League, Patriotic Fund, Knights of Columbus, Children’s Hospital,
Victorian Order, Salvation Army, Maternity Hospital, and the Canadian Red
Cross.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>For two years a rest and refreshment room has been conducted
at the city market and has been of great benefit to the market
people who often drive long distances.</p>

<p class='c007'>For two years the Halifax Dispensary has had the assistance
daily of a member for clerical work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Halifax Welfare, Victorian Order of Nurses, and many
other organizations have had assistance, and many kindnesses have
been performed, such as assistance given at orphans’ picnics.</p>

<p class='c007'>First aid booths have been conducted at exhibitions, Wanderers’
Athletic Grounds, and first aid rendered during public processions
and individually in the every-day life of the members.</p>

<p class='c007'>All service rendered except that required in the last two sections
of the Women’s Aid Department has been voluntary and performed
quietly and systematically in times of emergencies, and in war as
in times of peace for the public good.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE DISASTER WORK</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is unnecessary here to refer to the causes and disastrous
results of the great explosion on the morning of December 6, 1917.
As nearly as can be ascertained more than 1,500 people lost their
lives, approximately 5,000 people were injured, of whom about
1,000 received more or less serious injuries. With hundreds of
other citizens the members of the Halifax Divisions of the Brigade
responded at once to the calls for assistance, and within an hour
more than 140 members were on duty in the devastated area; on
the Common, in improvised aid stations, and in the various emergency
hospitals rendering first aid to the injured, the very object
for which they had all been trained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the afternoon and through the two or three days following
they added to their duties those of material relief, and until
a few days later the citizens’ organization was established when
the Brigade workers were fitted in under their Lady Superintendent
as part of the medical relief work.</p>

<p class='c007'>About sixty of the members remained on duty as V.A.D.’s in
Camp Hill Hospital, the Y.M.C.A., Morris Street, and the various
other hospitals for from one to five months following the explosion.
For a short period following the disaster eight members of the St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>John (N.B.) Division assisted the local division in providing personnel
for the various hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The total of the services rendered during the period December
6th to 31st shows 1,098 days of hospital work, 217 cases of district
relief followed up, 140 missing children located, as well as other
missing persons traced, food distributed, and first aid service
rendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>An official report forwarded through regular channels to the
headquarters of the Brigade in England was referred by headquarters
to the parent organization, the Ancient Order of the Hospital
of St. John of Jerusalem in England, and in the spring of
1920 selected members of the Halifax Division and various citizens
who co-operated with the Brigade in its invaluable work, were
presented by the Lieutenant-Governor with the beautifully engraved
certificates of thanks of the Order for their services rendered on
the occasion of the disaster.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CRECHE AT PIER NO. 2, HALIFAX.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>In the spring of 1917, when the German submarines were trying
to starve Britain into surrender, the Canadian Government
thought it wise to bring home the dependants of our soldiers
who were not actually engaged in war work in the United Kingdom.
The <em>Olympic</em> arrived in Halifax Port one morning with
1,000 women and children aboard, as well as her usual number of
invalided soldiers. Many hours passed before the last travellers
entrained for their homes, and one may imagine the scene at Pier 2
where these tired women waited for long hours with no shelter or
food and no comforts for their little ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was felt that something must be done to welcome those soldiers’
dependants who had left their loved ones in England or
France, and who could not surmise what the future held in store
for those from whom they were separated. A committee of ladies
was formed to look after all soldiers’ dependants on their arrival
in Canada. Spacious rooms, with kitchen, dining-room, rest-room,
nursery and bath-rooms were provided by the Government at
Pier 2, together with a sum of money sufficient to furnish
necessaries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>For three years a band of ladies under the presidency—first of
Mrs. Benson, wife of General Benson, and later of Mrs. J. G.
McDougall—met all boats and cared for all travellers with the most
wonderful devotion. As soon as the gangway was secured their
work began. It mattered not whether the ship was docked at
7 a.m., or at midnight, on a summer morning, or on a cold winter
evening, the workers were always there. Two of the Committee
went on board to see if there were any special cases to be looked
after and to notify those aboard of the Creche Committee’s willingness
to help them in every possible way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some stood at the gangway to welcome tired mothers and relieve
them of their tiny but very heavy burdens. Others led them to the
warm and comfortable quarters provided for them. In the kitchen
busy hands had been at work, and sandwiches and fragrant hot
coffee were not wanting; while in the nursery many young girls
were preparing beds with cool white sheets in which to lay Canada’s
young and welcome immigrants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the railway authorities were wonderfully expeditious
in getting the trains despatched, still many hours had to be spent at
the Creche—days sometimes—and, once or twice, even nights. The
scenes when a boat arrived with many hundreds of women and
children defy description. Parties were constantly being brought
to the rooms by willing and helpful guides. If husband or father
was there, he saw his dear ones safely housed, and he himself
returned to look after the tickets and baggage. If the mother was
in charge, she accompanied her little ones to the Creche, and after
seeing them safe and happy, was assisted in collecting her baggage
and procuring transportation. Kind hands undressed the babies,
washed, warmed and fed them and laid them to sleep in comfort.
The older children were also fed and then amused by toys and
picture books. Older travellers, completely tired out by the long and
often rough voyage, found indeed a warm and steady bed a source of
joy. Times and movements of trains were called in the waiting
rooms, and to the outgoing trains the travellers were finally escorted,
as comfortable and as happy as it was possible to make them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Red Cross placed a most efficient trained nurse at the disposal
of the Committee, and it is not possible to tell how much her
services were appreciated by those who, though not fit for hospital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>and anxious to complete their journey, were still much in need of
care. In a general way, as well as in her professional capacity, the
trained nurse rendered services of a very high order. Space does
not permit to tell of all the various activities carried on at the
Creche—money was exchanged, hotel accommodation secured for
those remaining over in Halifax for a few days, telegrams were
sent, meal tickets given to those who needed them on the trains,
babies were supplied with necessaries for travelling, and money was
many times given to those who through stress of circumstances had
not the wherewithal to complete their journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The returned men were always eager to assist in any way they
could, and the bands of the Canadian Battalions gave all great
pleasure by their delightful music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrangements were made for any needing hospital care; and
they were continually visited by members of the Committee while in
Halifax City. The military authorities placed an ambulance at the
disposal of the Committee for such cases. The Committee had the
fullest support and co-operation of the military authorities. They
also had the assistance of a hundred workers who gave up all
engagements and pleasures when it was known that a boat was
expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Creche Committee deeply regretted the departure from
Halifax of Mrs. Benson and Mrs. McKelvey Bell, under whom they
began their work. The ladies who carried on to the close of operation
were:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The Creche closed on 31st December, 1919. Since the 18th
November, 1918, the Committee and its helpers met 120 ships laden
with returning Canadian soldiers, their wives and families. On
one steamship alone, the <em>Megantic</em>, were 600 women and children,
180 of the children being under twelve months of age. On several
occasions there have been as many as 900 women and children on a
steamer, and, in one instance, the <em>Olympic</em> brought 1,000. All were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>sent on their homeward journey rested, refreshed, and cheered;
and the kindly welcome they received has made the name of the
Atlantic Gateway dear to the hearts of thousands of people the
Dominion over. Countless letters bear testimony to unfeigned
appreciation and gratitude. One newspaper extract may be permitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Ottawa Journal</cite> of December 28, 1918, says: “While this
work, and, to a large extent, its financial obligations have been
borne almost entirely by the citizens of Halifax, as the benefits
accrue to the country as a whole the gratitude of the people of
Canada is due to the small band of workers who for the past
eighteen months have generously and patriotically assumed the
burden for the whole Dominion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Those were busy days at Pier 2; and although much sacrifice was
demanded of the Halifax Creche Committee, it is not too much to
say that it was willingly and joyfully given by those who wished to
have some small share in the work of the Great War.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER LVII.<br /> <em>ST. MATTHEW’S CHURCH AND THE WAR.</em></h2>
</div>
<p class='c034'>[A description of the work done by each of the churches in Nova Scotia
would require a book in itself. The following article on the activities of
St. Matthew’s Church, Halifax, is typical of the manner in which the churches
of all denominations throughout the Province watched over the spiritual
and material welfare of men of the Overseas’ Units.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Early in the War, as soon as it became evident to the citizens
of Halifax that the struggle against “Might” would endure
for some time, and that this station would become again and
remain an important rendezvous for the army and navy while
hostilities lasted, the question of showing some tangible appreciation
to the volunteers who were rallying to the colors became paramount
in many minds. Noticing the presence of many of these men at
the regular church services in St. Matthew’s the minister (Rev.
J. W. Macmillan, D.D.) conceived the idea of having special receptions
so that they, while in Halifax, should find a real church
home and get sociably acquainted with members of the congregation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such receptions were held at the close of the usual Sunday
evening services. Many of the men were met thus and later welcomed
at various homes during the week. It was later found
expedient for these hosts to join forces so as to be able to entertain
larger numbers than could be accommodated at the houses, and it
was thus that the Thursday evening entertainments originated in
the schoolroom of St. Matthew’s Church during October, 1914.
These gained immediately in popularity until crowded houses with
S.R.O. signs continued for five winters without intermittence,
except for a few weeks following the great explosion of December,
1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies of the congregation were from first to last the chief
motive power at all these meetings, and the secret of their success.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Some were not publicly in evidence but worked “behind the scenes”
in supplying and providing the refreshments that formed a most
important part of these functions and did yeoman service. The
work was quickly organized into a perfect system, everybody being
assigned to a task that suited the particular attitude of the worker,
with plenty of eager helpers always on hand as reserves.</p>

<p class='c007'>This organization was not any premeditated system nor was it
arranged on the basis of any other movement, but being almost
impromptu formed itself with a naturalness according to the needs
as they developed until it appeared to become as perfect as is
humanly possible and so it continued with an earnest patriotic zeal
on the part of the people anxious to help but unable to go to the
field of war because of their sex or their age limit. Some distinguished
themselves as caterers, cooks, coffee makers, waiters or
waitresses and even as dishwashers. Others at the doors as welcoming
committees or indoors as cartoon makers, lantern manipulators,
contest managers, leaders of choruses and accompanists or
“masters of ceremonies” and chairmen. Others again found work
in advertising the meetings at the various ships and barracks until
it became the rule that every new Regiment or warship arriving at
Halifax was promptly advised of these Thursday evening meetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entertainment itself evolved into a systematic method by
natural causes too, rather than by design. Noting the crowds of
soldiers and sailors on the streets at an early hour the doors were
opened at 6.30 p.m. and immediately the hall began filling. To
entertain the early arrivals a magic lantern displayed reproductions
of recent war cartoons and cheery messages, while various popular
songs and choruses thrown on the screen by the same method with
a good accompanist at the piano got every one settled down for a
hearty sing-song. Each week the cartoons were supplemented with
additions and new songs added, along with items of current interest
and latest news, more pictures of local topics and jokes that were
fully appreciated. These opening features proved attractive and
were followed with some contest varying weekly in their style and
nature, for which prizes were awarded—always two at the least and
sometimes as many as twelve, most of them being made and given
by the ladies of the congregation—that were keenly contested for by
the men in uniform. This first portion of the meeting soon became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>an essential part of the entertainment and was usually controlled
by a “master of ceremonies,” who between 7.45 to 8 o’clock would
surrender his position to the chairman of the evening, and he in
turn would call the meeting to order with the singing of the
National Anthem, and after a few words of welcome the concert
proper was conducted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this respect all the best and cleverest artists, without distinction
of class or creed, responded willingly and enthusiastically
to the committees having charge of the programmes. These committees
rotated in their work and there arose a healthy competition
between them in acquiring special performers and singers to assure
successful concerts.</p>

<p class='c007'>At nine o’clock an adjournment for refreshments took place.
This half-hour provided an opportunity for conversation as well as
for eating; the lantern threw cartoons and pictures, jokes and songs
on the screen so that good humor continued to prevail. During
this interval some committee members moved among the audience
seeking for impromptu items for a programme that was continued
along with choruses from 9.30 to 10 o’clock and even later for the
benefit of such as had special “late leave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The interest in these entertainments did not wane. It never
flagged at any period of the five winters. The workers never tired
of their tasks, nor was there ever any difficulty noticed in obtaining
a bountiful supply of musical talent or refreshments to ensure
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secret of any extra degree of popularity for these Thursday
evenings cannot be attributed to any one cause but rather to a combination
of circumstances. To a great degree the down-town
position of St. Matthew’s made a strong appeal. The early start of
these concerts caused them to be better known perhaps, and the
fact of their regularity and continuity helped matters greatly, and
yet, perhaps more than all, the ladies of St. Matthew’s were a greater
factor than all these. This can be stated without in any degree
disparaging the great work done by other churches and institutions
or of ladies who were equally active in other places, and yet
these ladies as a body were able to greet all the men in uniform
with a heartiness that was promptly felt and without at any time
the semblance of that familiarity that breeds contempt or of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>patronizing air to which soldiers and sailors especially are most
sensitive, and at no time was there anything but the most respectful
and kindly feeling shown on either side.</p>

<p class='c007'>No smoking was indulged in at these gatherings, and none appeared
to wish the privilege. The men refrained out of their
natural respect to the ladies in the audience. Later on some “No
Smoking Allowed” signs were placed in the ante-rooms, where
some were wont to indulge in a few puffs during the intervals, but
this was done on account of the fire risks in the older part of the
structure and did not occasion much if any comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the credit of the men themselves it can be recorded now that
though between 125 and 150 of these meetings were held and the
average attendance was well over 400 men in uniform at each, only
two men were noticed to be the worse for liquor, and one of these
occasioned the only instance of a disagreement over any contest
that took place on those evenings, and in his case the offender came
back to the following meeting and apologized for his own unseemly
behavior. This is a record for our soldiers and sailors of which
the people of St. Matthew’s feel particularly proud. In itself it
repays them fully for any efforts that were undertaken and leaves
them ready to entertain such men whenever an opportunity occurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sunday evening services of song were in some respects even
more successful than the Thursday night concerts. A better chance
to meet and know the men was afforded, and a better opportunity
provided to intermingle and converse. The strangers invariably
seemed to meet people from their own home towns or provinces,
and the men from Britain found enthusiasts from Scotland, England,
Ireland or Wales ready to greet them on mutual racial
grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The addresses on these occasions always had a more serious,
religious or sentimental strain than was noticeable on week nights,
and the Rev. Dr. Clarke, who succeeded Dr. Macmillan in 1916 as
minister of the congregation was always ready to tell a good story
and point a moral with good effect. The lantern was used for
throwing the words of well-known hymn tunes on the screen, and
the singing often had the fervor of a revival meeting. As each
Unit or Regiment was known to be embarking for the Front, “God
Be With You Till We Meet Again” was invariably sung and often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>that hymn, “Eternal Father Strong to Save” and various war-time
versions thereof were prayerfully sung. Besides the hymn
singing there were always solos, duets or quartettes rendered by
the church choir and other artists. Refreshments were served
before dispersing, but were plainer than the fare dispensed on
Thursdays, being confined to tea and biscuits so as to lessen the
labor in deference to the Sabbath. These however, were greatly
appreciated by men who had eaten their suppers at 4 p.m. with no
other meal in prospect until the next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some thousands signed their autographs in visitors’ books that
were frequently passed around for signature, and among them are
those of hundreds who now lie in Flanders fields or gave their lives
for God and King and Country in other spheres of the War zone.
Many appreciatory letters were received from boys and men after
they left Halifax, expressing their appreciation of these receptions,
some of them comparing the wintry nights in the trenches or on
the North Sea with the peaceful hours spent at St. Matthew’s.
Many wives and mothers in all parts of Canada have heard of
St. Matthew’s and Halifax and have shown their thankfulness in
many ways for the attention given their husbands and sons while
here. The work of the Halifax Churches combined with the activities
of the Citizens’ Reception Committee and the Y.M.C.A. work
at Pier 2 throughout the War have made the name of Halifax well
and favorably known throughout the land. Even now that the War
is over the duty of the churches towards the strangers within their
gates should be continued—the need is great though the boys and
men may not be in uniform and many of these could enjoy and
appreciate as the soldiers and sailors did, a warm and kindly welcome
from a Christian community.</p>

<p>COL. W. E. THOMPSON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To the organizing ability, and more especially the extraordinary
genius for administration, of Col. W. E. Thompson must be given
the chief credit for the splendid achievement and unsullied record of
Military District No. 6. Second in Command of the 63rd Halifax
Rifles at the outbreak of the War, he was, in December, 1914,
called in by headquarters to assume the duties of Inspector of Outposts
and Detachments throughout the district, with the rank of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Lieutenant-Colonel. In March, 1915, he was appointed Assistant
Adjutant-General and Officer in Charge of Administration of
Military District No. 6. In May, 1916, he was promoted to the
rank of Colonel; and during the summer of that year, in addition
to his duties as Assistant Adjutant-General, was Commandant of
the Camp at Aldershot. In December, 1918, Colonel Thompson
succeeded to the command of Military District No. 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of his personality and of his genius for organization
and, more particularly, administration, on the whole service of
Military District No. 6, as well as on its morale, was extraordinary.
He was regarded by Headquarters Staff, even by the three General
Officers Commanding, before he succeeded to the command, as the
authentic administrative “Mind” of the district. No other military
district had such varied and great administrative problems and
such heavy responsibilities as Military District No. 6, and yet the
War was concluded with not a single mark against the administration
and not a breath of scandal on its personnel and their
conduct of the various Departments. For that splendid achievement
Colonel Thompson was chiefly responsible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In heart, however, he was eminently the soldier. Repeatedly he
volunteered for active service Overseas, and even specially appealed
to Ottawa for permission to go Overseas with a Unit, but the
Canadian Militia Department was obdurate, declaring that his
genius for organization and administration was of such a character
that he could not be spared from headquarters Military District
No. 6. Strict, firm, and soldierly at headquarters, Colonel Thompson,
notwithstanding, exemplified democracy in the most undemocratic
of institutions, the army. His genuine democracy, his
tempering of justice with mercy, and his fine kindliness won for
him the high respect and admiration of all ranks.</p>

<hr class='c026' />

<p class='c007'>Col. Gordon S. Harrington, K.C., is a son of the late C. S.
Harrington, K.C., of Halifax, N.S. He was admitted to the Bar
on October 19, 1904, and practised his profession at Glace Bay, N.S.
He was one of the original Company Commanders of the 85th
Battalion with the rank of Major, and, on the formation of the
Nova Scotia Highland Brigade, returned to Cape Breton and supervised
the recruiting of the 185th Battalion. He was transferred to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>that Unit with his rank of Major and proceeded Overseas with it.
When the Brigade was broken up he was sent to the Imperial First
Senior Infantry School at Bedford, where he passed the qualifying
examination with the highest marks ever attained at that institution.
On reporting to the Nova Scotia Regimental Depot at Bramshott
he was posted to the 17th Reserve Battalion, of which he was successively
Second in Command and O.C. In May, 1917, he was
transferred to the Staff of the Overseas Minister, London, and a
short time later was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister. In 1918
he was appointed Deputy Minister and promoted to the rank of
Colonel. He served in the field on Corps Headquarters.</p>

<p>COL. GORDON S. HARRINGTON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr class='c026' />

<p class='c007'>Having in mind the fact that at the sudden outbreak of war,
August, 1914, the permanent military force of Canada only numbered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>3,075, it will be readily understood that the Department of
Militia and Defence was at once compelled to grapple with an
enormous task for which no one could expect it to be prepared.
The situation had to be met. The work had to be done. It had to
be done quickly, and it is to the everlasting credit of Canada that
we had men of outstanding ability and energy to cope successfully
with the urgent situation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_404.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>HON. F. B. M‘CURDY,<br />Secretary of Department of Militia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By July, 1916, our military force was 312,844. Of these
136,185 were in Canada and 176,659 were Overseas. The number
was daily increasing; and only those who were in close touch with
the tremendous work of organizing, equipping, supplying and despatching
such an army can realize what that meant in comparison
with the work of administering affairs in regard to about 3,000 men
during times of peace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>In these circumstances, and in view of the further fact that the
exigencies of affairs frequently called the Minister of Militia away
from Ottawa for the purpose of visiting recruiting centres and
military camps in Canada, as well as Canadian Headquarters in
England, the Government decided that it was necessary to have a
Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Militia and Defence;
and, accordingly, on July 16, 1916, by an Order-in-Council the office
was created endowing the holder with general authority in regard
to administration of the Department, and directing that during the
absence from Ottawa of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary
should also preside at all meetings of the Militia Council and report
to the Privy Council through the Prime Minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, the services of a man of wide experience in business
affairs, of well-known executive ability and withal energetic in
discharge of duty, in the person of Mr. F. B. McCurdy, M.P., was
available, and the Prime Minister wisely asked him to take up this
very important work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. McCurdy willingly agreed; but with one stipulation. The
salary affixed to the office was $5,000. Mr. McCurdy was past
military age, but he believed that every man should, as far as was
in his power, contribute to national duty. He, therefore, stipulated
that his services as Parliamentary Secretary of the Militia Department
would be a free contribution to the country, and he so served.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after Mr. McCurdy’s appointment, Sir Sam
Hughes, Minister of Militia and Defence, went Overseas; and from
that time, which, it will be remembered, was a very active and
critical period of the War, until the creation of the Ministry of
Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Mr. McCurdy played a very
important part in the vital work of building up and strengthening
Canada’s great army.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally Mr. McCurdy while discharging his weighty duties
with due and patriotic regard to the national interests of the whole
country, had a sympathetic ear for his fellow Nova Scotians; and
it is well known that his good judgment and influential voice prevailed
in regard to irritating questions as to the representation of
Battalions at the Front, with results that afforded great satisfaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>to the people of his native Province. It is sufficient to say that
Mr. McCurdy’s eminent record as Parliamentary Secretary proved
the unerring judgment of the Prime Minister in selecting the right
men for responsible positions.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the election of December, 1917, Mr. McCurdy was returned
by acclamation for Colchester, his native county.</p>

survivors, and of the hospital personnel of ninety-seven only
one officer and five other ranks escaped. In spite of their appalling
circumstances the conduct of all on board was in fitting keeping with
the proudest traditions of the British Army and the mercantile

<p class='c007'>“On September the 28th, when the advance of the Brigade
was held up by fire on both flanks and by thick, uncut wire, he
crawled forward alone and explored the wire until he found a
small gap, through which he subsequently led his men and forced
an entry into the enemy trench. The enemy counter-attacked in
force and through lack of bombs the situation became critical.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>“Gregg, although wounded, returned alone under a terrific fire
and collected a further supply, then rejoined his party which was
now much reduced. Despite a second wound he reorganized his
men and led them in the most determined way against the enemy
trenches, which he finally
cleared. He personally
killed or wounded
eleven of the enemy and
took twenty-five prisoners,
besides capturing
twelve machine guns in
this trench. Remaining
with the Company, despite
his wounds, he
again, on September
30th, led the men in
attack until severely
wounded. The outstanding
valor of this officer
saved many casualties
and enabled the advance
to continue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pte. John Croak,
V.C., was born in Newfoundland
and came to
Glace Bay with his parents
at four years of age. He attended St. John’s School, New
Aberdeen, Glace Bay, and afterwards worked as a miner in No. 2
Colliery, Glace Bay (the biggest in the world). He volunteered for
Overseas service in the 55th Battalion and was transferred to the
13th Battalion. He died of wounds received in action on August
8, 1918. His father, mother, two sisters and two brothers are living
at Glace Bay.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>The official notice from the War Office announcing the award
of the Victoria Cross was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“On August 8, 1918, during the attack on Amiens Defence
System, after being separated from his section, Private Croak
encountered a machine-gun nest in Ring Copse, which he dealt with
by first bombing unassisted and then jumping into the post, taking
the gun and crew prisoners. Shortly afterwards he was severely
wounded in the right arm but refused to desist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few minutes his Platoon, which this soldier had rejoined,
again encountered a very strong point, containing several machine-guns
and they were forced to take cover. Private Croak, however,
seeing an opportunity, dashed forward alone, and was almost immediately
followed by the remainder of the Platoon in a brilliant
charge. He was the first to arrive at the trench line, into which he
led the men, capturing three machine-guns and bayoneting or capturing
the entire garrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The perseverance and courage of this gallant man were undoubtedly
responsible for taking the strongest point in the whole
day’s advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Private Croak was again severely wounded in the knee and
died in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 23, 1918, Lieutenant-Governor Grant formally
presented the Victoria Cross to his
mother, Mrs. James Croak, of New
Aberdeen, Cape Breton. The Lieutenant-Governor
complimented the parents and
a sister who accompanied them on the
fact that their son and brother had so
well demonstrated that he came of good
stock and was a good soldier, a brave
man, and a hero.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>“Felt Dawn”</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>By Stuart McCawley</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>We were sitting on the beach at Mira. Just a lovely
Cape Breton moonlight night. The youngsters
were singing and telling yarns. One kid recited
McCrae’s great poem, “In Flanders Fields,” and one of
the boys who had been “over there” asked us if we knew
what McCrae meant when he wrote the phrase, “Felt
Dawn.” Nobody seemed to be entirely clear on the
question, and we asked our friend, the veteran, to describe
it for us. Here are his words:</p>

<p class='c019'>A cold, drizzly rain that is eating through your khaki
into your very heart.</p>

<p class='c019'>A sea of mud—black, slimy, sticky, stinking mud.</p>

<p class='c019'>The duck boards floating in ooze.</p>

<p class='c019'>Your feet wet and heavy, and your toes squichy.</p>

<p class='c019'>Not a sound of any kind.</p>

<p class='c019'>The nearest human ten yards away—just around
“the bay.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Darkness supreme. Not even an enemy flare.</p>

<p class='c019'>You strain your eyes over the parapet to the barbwire.</p>

<p class='c019'>Your battalion’s life depends on your keeping awake.</p>

<p class='c019'>Oh, the strain! Oh, the funk that is trying to grip
your very soul!</p>

<p class='c019'>Would to God something would happen! This eternal
watching is fearful.</p>

<p class='c019'>Then a rustle in the grass; a wave of movement first
like the ripple you hear when a stone is “skipped” on a
quiet pond; then an extra chill in the air: then a glow to
the east—’Tis Dawn.</p>

<p class='c019'>You let loose your “clip” and you fire like mad
towards the Hun. Other sentries fire, and the salvo to
dawn gets the whole line. Thousands of men all along
the front start a strafe—a crazy, aimless strafe—which
lasts for only minutes. Then, as if some great unseen
General had whispered a command, men regain their
“morale,” and the rifle fire quietens, and dies away.</p>

<p class='c019'>The sun struggles up.</p>

<p class='c019'>A bird on a shattered stump whistles, “Coo, Coo.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Your blood warms again. You have “felt dawn.”
Another day has had its birth. The rations will soon be
up. Relief is coming. The war is still on, and the bird
has showed you that, after all, it is better to smile than
to worry.</p>

<p class='c019'>God is still in command!</p>

<p class='c000'>¶ Here is the plan under which many of our clients, setting aside sums as
small as $10 monthly, have accumulated $5,000 and upwards with annual
additions of more than $300 to their incomes.</p>

<p class='c000'>¶ You buy through us a security of recognized merit, yielding 6% or more
for municipals, 7% or more for Corporation bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>¶ You pay $10 a month for each $100 and are charged with 6% interest on unpaid
balances but are credited immediately with the full interest on your investment,
as paid.</p>

<p class='c000'>¶ As you proceed with your payments the difference of interest in your favor
increases, adding to your income, and as time goes on the purchase of one
security after another brings you nearer to independence</p>
